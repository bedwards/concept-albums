# LYRICS


VERSE1
Roman stone sealed tight
Guards at the gate
Bury what threatens the throne
Women came at dawn

VERSE2
Mary first to see
The lynched one risen
Rich men wanted underground
Can't keep resurrection bound

VERSE3
When they seal the door
Say the uprising's over
Friday wasn't the end
Sunday coming

VERSE1
Roman stone sealed tight
Guards at the gate
Bury what threatens the throne
Women came at dawn

VERSE2
Mary first to see
The lynched one risen
Rich men wanted underground
Can't keep resurrection bound

VERSE3
When they seal the door
Say the uprising's over
Friday wasn't the end
Sunday coming

BUILD1
Every empire falls
Every Pharaoh dies
The stone keeps rolling
Crushing what it strikes

CHORUS
Stone rolled away
Stone rolled away
He is not here
Guards ran in fear
Death couldn't hold
What the powerful killed

CHORUS
Stone rolled away
Stone rolled away
He is not here
Guards ran in fear
Death couldn't hold
What the powerful killed

OUTRO
Stone keeps rolling
Can't stop what's risen
Stone keeps rolling
Rejected stone chosen
Rolling through Texas tonight
Walking in resurrection light
