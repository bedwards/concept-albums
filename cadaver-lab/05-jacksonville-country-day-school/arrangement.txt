TEMPO: 80 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Emin

INTRO
PIANO ALONE. Formal, slightly cold. The sound of institution.
This is the first track where piano leads - it establishes the
emotional temperature of privilege and its loneliness.

VERSE
GUITAR ENTERS verse 1, bass verse 2, brushes verse 2.
Piano continues throughout - the formal backbone.

Verse 1: The uniform - "khaki pants and polo shirts"
Verse 2: The loneliness - "learned to eat alone"
Verse 3: The silence - "conversion van" callback, "never asked"
Verse 4: Understanding - "now I understand the armor"

Vocal delivery: Gentle, not accusatory. This is empathy.

CHORUS
FULLER but still restrained.
"That's where you learned to disappear" - the thesis.
"By the silence you still wear" - knowing through absence.

BRIDGE
INSTRUMENTAL. Piano and guitar interweaving.
The sound of understanding without words.

OUTRO
PIANO FADES LAST. The institution outlasts the person.
Final Em chord on piano, sustained, then silence.

~5 minutes. Formal, sad, empathetic.
