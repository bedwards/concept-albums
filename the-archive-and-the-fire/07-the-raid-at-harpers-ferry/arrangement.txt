TEMPO: 66 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Em

INTRO
Guitar: Em arpeggio, mournful and deliberate. Sets the weight of history.
Bass: Root notes, steady pulse. Drums: None yet.

VERSE
Vocal: Direct narrative delivery. The facts speak.
Verse 1: The raid itself - October 1859, eighteen men, the armory
Verse 2: The failure - no uprising came, captured by Lee's marines
Verse 3: The trial - his defense, the double standard
Verse 4: The execution - his prophecy about blood
Verse 5: The aftermath - six hundred thousand dead, his name in the marching song

Guitar: Fingerpicked arpeggios throughout.
Bass: Root notes, walking occasionally.
Drums: Brush kick/snare, silent on empty lines.

CHORUS
"One man's treason is another's truth" - the thesis
Not celebrating violence. Acknowledging complexity.
Guitar: Fuller but still restrained.
Bass: More movement. Drums: Steady brushes.

BRIDGE
Instrumental. The weight of what's coming.
Guitar: Minor progression, descending.
Bass: Sustained pedal tones. Drums: Kick only, no snare.

OUTRO
Return to intro pattern. Slower, more space.
End on open Em chord. Let it ring into silence.

PRODUCTION NOTES:
- This is the first "historical" song on the album (pre-20th century)
- Sets up the pattern: violence in service of conscience
- Not hagiography - Brown was a violent man who killed people
- But he was right about the blood that was coming
- ~7 minutes. Room to breathe between verses.
