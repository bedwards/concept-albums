TEMPO: 84 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: C

INTRO
GUITAR ALONE. Simple C-Am pattern. The sound of rewinding.

VERSE
BASS ENTERS verse 2 - quiet, supporting.
NO DRUMS. This song stays intimate throughout.

Verse 1: The tape itself - "handwritten track list, blue ink"
Verse 2: Making it - "drove to Hastings" (the video store)
Verse 3: Now - "shuffle... sequence all wrong"

"Pulp Fiction on the first side" - specific, proves this happened.
Vocal delivery: Tender, not nostalgic.

CHORUS
"By the songs they give you" - knowing through curation.
Guitar slightly fuller, still fingerpicked.

OUTRO
GUITAR ALONE again. Slow fade.
~3:15. The shortest full song with bass.
Simple, direct, like the tape itself.
