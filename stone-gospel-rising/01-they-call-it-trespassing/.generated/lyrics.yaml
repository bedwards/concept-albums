song:
  title: They Call It Trespassing
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - They call it trespassing
  - When the hungry cross your land
  - The earth is the Lord's
  - You built your fence in sand
  verse2:
  - Sheriff with his paper
  - Says who drinks who stays dry
  - Let justice roll like water
  - Not trickle from on high
  verse3:
  - Locked the courthouse door
  - We're sleeping on the stone
  - The land cannot be sold
  - The dirt remembers its own
  chorus:
  - The meek inherit Texas
  - Every acre every stone
  - Write your deed in Austin
  - The dirt knows who it owns
  - You can write your deed in Austin
  - But the dirt remembers who it owns
  bridge:
  - Woe to you who join house to house
  - Field to field no space left
  - Call it progress call it the Texas way
  - Isaiah named it
  - Theft
  outro:
  - They call it trespassing
  - We call it coming home
