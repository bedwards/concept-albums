# LYRICS


VERSE1
Model airplane on the shelf
P-51 Mustang, silver paint
He never talked about the war
Just built his models, never complained
Never complained

VERSE2
Medals in the bottom drawer
I found them after he was gone
Purple Heart and Silver Star
Never knew what he had done
What he had done

VERSE3
Sunday mornings at the hangar
Watching planes come in to land
He'd name them all, every model
But never what they were for
What they were for

VERSE4
I build the model now myself
Silver paint and glue that stings
My hands shake where his stayed steady
Steady through everything, through everything
Through everything

VERSE1
Model airplane on the shelf
P-51 Mustang, silver paint
He never talked about the war
Just built his models, never complained
Never complained

VERSE2

I found them after he was gone
Purple Heart and Silver Star
Never knew what he had done
What he had done

VERSE3
Sunday mornings at the hangar
Watching planes come in to land
He'd name them all, every model
But never what they were for
What they were for

VERSE4
I build the model now myself
Silver paint and glue that stings
My hands shake where his stayed steady
Steady through everything, through everything
Through everything

CHORUS
P-51 Mustang, P-51
Silver paint and silence
P-51 Mustang, P-51
And I would know you anywhere
