# LYRICS


VERSE1
My grandfather kept a locked drawer
Full of things he never showed
Letters from the union hall
Names of men the bosses chose

He said son there's a difference clear
Between the ones who talk and act
Between the knowing and the doing
Between the forward and the back

VERSE2
I found his papers when he died
Mimeographed and coffee-stained
Meetings held in basements dark
Every single name erased

Not for glory or for fame
Not for history's gentle hand
Just because the work was there
Just because they took a stand

VERSE3
There's a server farm in Iceland
Holding terabytes of truth
Documents that powerful men
Would kill to keep from you

Someone risked their life for this
Someone chose the harder road
You'll never know their name or face
But you're holding what they chose

VERSE4
Tonight I'm in my kitchen late
Reading what I shouldn't read
Tomorrow I could forward this
Or let it die with me

My children sleeping down the hall
My job waiting in the morning
The locked drawer in my desk
Already calling

VERSE1
My grandfather kept a locked drawer
Full of things he never showed
Letters from the union hall
Names of men the bosses chose

He said son there's a difference clear
Between the ones who talk and act
Between the knowing and the doing
Between the forward and the back

VERSE2
I found his papers when he died
Mimeographed and coffee-stained
Meetings held in basements dark
Every single name erased

Not for glory or for fame
Not for history's gentle hand
Just because the work was there
Just because they took a stand

VERSE3
There's a server farm in Iceland
Holding terabytes of truth
Documents that powerful men
Would kill to keep from you

Someone risked their life for this
Someone chose the harder road
You'll never know their name or face
But you're holding what they chose

VERSE4
Tonight I'm in my kitchen late
Reading what I shouldn't read
Tomorrow I could forward this
Or let it die with me

My children sleeping down the hall
My job waiting in the morning
The locked drawer in my desk
Already calling

CHORUS1
This is what we inherit
The weight of choosing right
Not the glory or the story
Just the choice we make tonight

This is what we're given
What the ones before us left
Not a name carved in marble
Just the locked drawer in the desk

VERSE1
My grandfather kept a locked drawer
Full of things he never showed
Letters from the union hall
Names of men the bosses chose

Between the ones who talk and act
Between the knowing and the doing
Between the forward and the back

VERSE2

Mimeographed and coffee-stained

Not for history's gentle hand
Just because the work was there
Just because they took a stand
