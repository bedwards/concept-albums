# CHORDS


VERSE1
Em
Beige chickens in the morning
C
Same birds every day
G  D
Pecking at the gravel
Em
In the same deliberate way
C  G
Deliberate way
Em


VERSE2
Em
She counted them like rosary beads
C
Before she'd go inside
G  D
Well-proportioned birds she called them
Em
Some small farmer's pride
C  G
Farmer's pride
Em


VERSE3
Em
She'd park my front door open
C
So I could watch her there
G  D
The way she'd talk to every one
Em
Stories in the morning air
C  G
Never told to anyone but them
Em

CHORUS
Em  G
Beige chickens, beige chickens

Pecking at the same gravel

Beige chickens, beige chickens
C  D
And I would know you anywhere

VERSE_CLIMAX
Em
The coop stands empty now
C
The feed bin rusted through
G  D
Fox got in or maybe time
Em
The yard holds only feathers
C  G
Only feathers


Em
I could rebuild the whole thing
C
Buy new birds and paint the wire
G  D
But her hands are in the wood grain
Em
And her voice is in the choir
C  D
The morning choir

CHORUS_FINAL
Em  G
Beige chickens in an ordinary yard
C  D
That's how you know someone
Em  G
By the ordinary things they tend
C  D
By the ordinary things they've done
Em  G
What they've done
C  Em
What they've done
