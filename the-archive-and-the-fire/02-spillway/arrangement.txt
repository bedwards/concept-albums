Bass: Root notes with occasional walks to next chord.
Drums: Brush kick/snare, verses 1-4. Silent on empty lyric lines.

PRODUCTION NOTES:
- Second song continues album's dry aesthetic
- Focus on the facts: Baghdad, the video, the informant, solitary, transition, commutation
- Empathy without judgment: "was that freedom, or was that treason"
- The spillway metaphor: once truth starts flowing, it can't be stopped
- Total length: ~6:30
