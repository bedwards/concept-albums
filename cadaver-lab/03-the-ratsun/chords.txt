# CHORDS


VERSE1
G
Faded blue and primer gray
C
The Ratsun in the driveway
Em  D
Keys still warm from your pocket
G
Passenger door that stuck
C  D
Until you knew just where to kick

VERSE2
G
AM radio and coffee cups
C
The smell of oil and August
Em  D
I learned the roads from your hands
G
On the wheel at ten and two
C  D
Every turn was something you knew

VERSE3
G
We drove to places that don't exist
C
On maps anymore
Em  D
Diners closed and dance halls gone
G
You showed me where the world had been
C  D
Before I was born

VERSE4
G
Now the truck sits where you left it
C
Weeds grown through the wheel wells
Em  D
I could fix it if I wanted
G
But I don't want to drive it
C  D
Without you riding shotgun

And I would know you anywhere
