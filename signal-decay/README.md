## Concept

A two-track single exploring the static between people. The A-side confronts loss directly - angular, desperate, the sound of reaching for a frequency that's already gone. The B-side is what happens after midnight in the studio: a faster, more hypnotic piece that never quite resolves, like a demo that caught something true before anyone could overthink it.

The fusion: post-punk's nervous angularity meets synthwave's cold shimmer. Jittery guitars against pulsing synthesizers. Human desperation encoded in machine rhythms.

## Track Listing

### A-Side
**01. Glass Frequencies**
*"I'm tuning to a station that went dark"*

108 BPM. Dm. The single. Angular post-punk guitar lines slice through cold synth pads. The rhythm section drives forward while the vocals pull back, desperate but controlled. Loss as a frequency you can almost hear. The chorus opens up slightly - not resolution, but the acknowledgment of emptiness.

Instrumentation: Synth pad, synth arpeggio, angular guitar, driving bass, drum machine, vocals

### B-Side
**02. Transmission Loss**
*Instrumental / demo*

138 BPM. Am. The throwaway that became essential. Recorded in one take at 2am. A motorik beat locks in while synthesizer arpeggios spiral upward. The bass is relentless. No vocals - just a transmission into void. Mesmerizing and slightly unhinged. The kind of track that sounds like it's decaying in real-time.

Instrumentation: Synth arpeggio, synth lead, bass sequence, drum machine

## Production Notes

**Sound Palette:**
- Synth pads: Warm but distant, slight detuning
- Arpeggios: Cold, crystalline, 16th notes
- Guitar: Clean with short delay, angular voicings, no distortion
- Bass: Synth bass or bass guitar with envelope filter
- Drums: Drum machine, not trying to sound human

**References:**
- The Cure "Seventeen Seconds" (the cold space)
- Depeche Mode "Black Celebration" (the synth textures)
- Siouxsie and the Banshees "Juju" (the angular guitars)
- Kraftwerk "Trans-Europe Express" (the motorik pulse)
