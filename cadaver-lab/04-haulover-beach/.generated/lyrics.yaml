song:
  title: Haulover Beach
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Haulover Beach in August
  - Salt water in our hair
  - Before we had to be anyone
  - We were just bodies there
  - Just bodies there
  verse2:
  - You in the shallows, backstroke
  - Against the afternoon
  - Whipper bugs at sunset
  - The water held the moon
  - Held the moon
  verse3:
  - Now the beach is smaller
  - Or maybe we grew strange
  - The salt still tastes the same though
  - Everything else has changed
  - Everything's changed
  chorus:
  - I knew you in the water
  - Before the land took hold
  - Haulover Beach, the tide comes in
  - And carries what we told
