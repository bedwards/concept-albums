# CHORDS


VERSE1
Am  F
Intelligence analyst in Baghdad heat
C  G
Watching drone footage on repeat
Am  F
Civilian bodies, Reuters journalists
C  G
The report said hostile forces hit


Am  F
But she had the video, had the proof
C  G
Twenty-two years old and bulletproof
Am  F
She burned it to a disk marked Lady Gaga
C  G
And sent the truth out into the dark

VERSE2
Am  F
Seven hundred thousand documents
C  G
War logs that showed what really went
Am  F
Down in Iraq and Afghanistan
C  G
The gap between the truth and what they said


Am  F
They found her through an informant
C  G
Someone she trusted, someone she told
Am  F
Thirty-five years in military prison
C  G
For showing the world what it should have known

VERSE3
Am  F
In solitary they made her stand at attention
C  G
Naked, at midnight, just because they can
Am  F
The UN said torture, America said necessary
C  G
For the soldier who leaked the war


Am  F
She came out as trans in a men's prison
C  G
Fought for hormones, fought to survive
Am  F
Attempted suicide twice before Obama
C  G
Commuted her sentence in twenty-seventeen

VERSE4
Am  F
Seven years served of thirty-five
C  G
She walks free but the record stays
Am  F
Felon, traitor, whistleblower, trans woman
C  G
Depending on who's keeping score these days


Am  F
But collateral murder is still on YouTube
C  G
The helicopter footage she released
Am  F
And now you know what she knew in Baghdad
C  G
Was that freedom, or was that treason

CHORUS1
F  C
When the spillway opens
G  Am
All the water's got to run
F  C
Can't hold back the flood
G  Am
Once the dam is done
