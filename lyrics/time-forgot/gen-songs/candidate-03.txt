/intro/
Do do dooo, do do do, do doo doo doooo
Do do dooo, do do do, do doo doo doooo

/verse-1/
My heart is broken and it's bleeding
I feel so very sad
Everything is really awful
My life has gone so bad

/chorus/
They say that things will get much better
Because tomorrow is a new day
But things forgot to get much better
Yes things forgot to get much better

/verse-2/
She was pretty and I liked her
We had some happy times
Now she's gone and I am lonely
I cannot make these rhymes

/verse-3/
I sat around and thought about it
I cried a lot of tears
I hope that someday I'll be happy
Maybe in some years

/chorus/
They say that things will get much better
Because tomorrow is a new day
But things forgot to get much better
Yes things forgot to get much better

/verse-4/
I tried to call her on the telephone
She would not pick it up
I left a message on the voicemail
I really messed things up

/verse-5/
I guess I learned a lot of lessons
About love and about pain
I hope the next time will be different
I won't make mistakes again

/outro/
She said that things will get much better
Because tomorrow is a new day
Do do dooo, do do do, do doo doo doooo
Do do dooo, do do do, do doo doo doooo
