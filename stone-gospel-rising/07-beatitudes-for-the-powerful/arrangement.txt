TEMPO: 85 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Dmin

INTRO
DOOM-SLOW 85 BPM - feels funereal, heavy.
Bass and pump organ only - ominous.
Bass D pedal tone, whole notes, let sustain.
Pump organ Dm sustained, reedy, uncomfortable, gothic.
No other instruments - establishing judgment tone.
8 bars to build dread.

VERSE
Kick heavy on 1 & 3. Snare backbeat 2 & 4, hard hits.
Bass root notes, quarter notes, trudging (Dm-Bb-F-Gm).
Pump organ whole note chords, sustained accusation.
Acoustic, electric silent - keep it sparse, oppressive.
Vocal almost chanted, like reading inverted liturgy.
"Blessed are..." sung gently (the scripture).
"You..." delivered as indictment (the contrast).
Each verse increases intensity but stays restrained.

CHORUS
All instruments enter with conviction but SLOW.
Kick heavy quarters, no doubles. Snare backbeat, rim shots on "woes".
Bass eighth notes but 85 BPM makes them feel like doom march.
Acoustic strumming, down strokes only, percussive.
Electric power chords Bb-F-Dm, palm mute, menacing.
Pump organ Bb-F-Dm voicings, half notes, piercing.
Vocal "These beatitudes turned back on you" - sung with prophetic authority.
"Whitewashed tombs" - let it hang in the air.

BRIDGE
Drop dynamics but maintain oppressive weight.
Kick just on 1 (sparse). Snare rim clicks on 2 & 4.
Bass walking quarter notes (Gm-Eb-Bb-F-Cm).
Acoustic fingerpick, dark arpeggios.
Electric sustained single notes, ominous.
Pump organ Gm-Eb sustained, building tension.
Vocal "Woe to you scribes and Pharisees" - spoken/chanted.
Direct address. Talarico-style righteous condemnation.
"Strain out gnats swallow camels whole" - spit it out.

OUTRO
Sudden dynamic drop. Bass and pump organ only return.
Vocal "Blessed are the poor / Woe to the rich" - sung quietly, intimately.
"Which one you listening for" - final question held, vulnerable.
End on Dm chord (bass and organ only).
Hold for 4 bars, natural decay into silence.
Ends on a question, unresolved - Dm minor = no hope offered.
The silence after is the answer. Let it crush.
