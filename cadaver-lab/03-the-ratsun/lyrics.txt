# LYRICS


VERSE1
Faded blue and primer gray
The Ratsun in the driveway
Keys still warm from your pocket
Passenger door that stuck
Until you knew just where to kick

VERSE2
AM radio and coffee cups
The smell of oil and August
I learned the roads from your hands
On the wheel at ten and two
Every turn was something you knew

VERSE3
We drove to places that don't exist
On maps anymore
Diners closed and dance halls gone
You showed me where the world had been
Before I was born

VERSE4
Now the truck sits where you left it
Weeds grown through the wheel wells
I could fix it if I wanted
But I don't want to drive it
Without you riding shotgun

VERSE1
Faded blue and primer gray
The Ratsun in the driveway
Keys still warm from your pocket
Passenger door that stuck
Until you knew just where to kick

VERSE2
AM radio and coffee cups
The smell of oil and August
I learned the roads from your hands
On the wheel at ten and two
Every turn was something you knew

VERSE3
We drove to places that don't exist
On maps anymore
Diners closed and dance halls gone
You showed me where the world had been
Before I was born

VERSE4
Now the truck sits where you left it
Weeds grown through the wheel wells
I could fix it if I wanted
But I don't want to drive it
Without you riding shotgun

CHORUS
The Ratsun holds what we were
Before the roads all changed
I know you by that engine sound
By every mile we made

Faded blue and primer gray
The Ratsun in the driveway

On the wheel at ten and two
Every turn was something you knew

You showed me where the world had been
