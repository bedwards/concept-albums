# CHORDS


VERSE1
Em
Tuesday morning, conversion van
C
Baptist church, the parking lot
G  D
Her hands on my shoulders at the door
Em  C
Then the door, then the hall, then the room
G  D
Then the window where I watched her go
Em


VERSE2
Em
Circle time and finger paint
C
Graham crackers on a paper plate
G  D
Alphabet rug beneath my knees
Em  C
I knew her car by the sound it made
G  D
But that sound didn't come
Em


VERSE3
Em
She drove the long way home alone
C
Radio off and windows down
G  D
Past the Hastings, past the Kroger
Em  C
Past the sheep farm on the county line
G  D
She needed the quiet, I was the noise
Em


VERSE4
Em
Now I know that everyone leaves
C
Everyone turns to face the wall
G  D
Everyone I've loved has closed a door
Em  C
And I have closed doors
G  D
That's not the wound, that's just the way
Em


VERSE5
Em
The Ratsun in an empty driveway
C
Beach chair folded against the rain
G  D
Mix tape rewound to the beginning
Em  C
Beige chickens in an empty yard
G  D
That's how you know them, by the space they leave
Em

VERSE_CLIMAX
Em
Charm, self-pity, and rage
C
All rotating through a single face
G  D
Cadaver lab where I learned the bones
Em  C
Mercury outboard in the morning haze
G  D

Em
Everyone I've memorized
C
Everyone whose hands I've held
G  D
Everyone returns to this
Em  C
The door, the hall, the room, the window
G  D
The car pulling away

Mother's Day Out
C  D
Now I understand

OUTRO
Em  C
Tuesday morning, my hands on her shoulders
G  D
Different church, the same parking lot
Em  C
She looks back once, I wave her through the door
G  Em
And I drive the long way home
