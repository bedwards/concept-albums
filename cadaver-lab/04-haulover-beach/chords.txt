# CHORDS


VERSE1
D
Haulover Beach in August
G
Salt water in our hair
A  Bm
Before we had to be anyone
D
We were just bodies there
G  D
Just bodies there

VERSE2
D
You in the shallows, backstroke
G
Against the afternoon
A  Bm
Whipper bugs at sunset
D
The water held the moon
G  D
Held the moon

VERSE3
D
Now the beach is smaller
G
Or maybe we grew strange
A  Bm
The salt still tastes the same though
D
Everything else has changed
G  D
Everything's changed

CHORUS
D  G
I knew you in the water
A  Bm
Before the land took hold
D  G
Haulover Beach, the tide comes in
A  D
And carries what we told
