song:
  title: Jacksonville Country Day School
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Khaki pants and polo shirts
  - Carpool line at seven thirty
  - Learning how to hold your face
  - When everything inside feels dirty
  - Feels dirty
  verse2:
  - You told me once about the cafeteria
  - Where you learned to eat alone
  - How the laughter sounded different
  - When it wasn't aimed at anyone you'd known
  - Anyone you'd known
  verse3:
  - The conversion van that picked you up
  - Your mother in the driver's seat
  - She never asked about your day
  - Just drove in silence down the street
  - Down the street
  verse4:
  - You still flinch at cafeterias
  - Still count the exits in a room
  - Your shoulders carry something old
  - Your spine holds the shape of Tuesday afternoon
  - Tuesday afternoon
  chorus:
  - Jacksonville Country Day
  - Khaki pants and carpool lane
  - Jacksonville Country Day
  - And I would know you anywhere
