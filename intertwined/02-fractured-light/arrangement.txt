INTRO
Guitar 1: Solo introduction. Rhythmic, syncopated melody with frequent rests. Use percussive attack on downbeats and let syncopated notes ring. Moderate dynamics (mf). Establish the fragmented, contemporary character of the piece.
Guitar 2: Silent for entire section.
Guitar 3: Silent for entire section.

PARTA
Guitar 1: Plays phrases with space between them (call). Use clear articulation and dynamic contrast. Phrases should feel like questions. Dynamics mf with accents on phrase beginnings.
Guitar 2: Responds to Guitar 1's phrases (response). Enters only when Guitar 1 rests. Different rhythmic character - more sustained notes. Dynamics mp-mf, growing in confidence.
Guitar 3: Silent - let the dialogue between guitars 1 and 2 develop.

PARTB
Guitar 1: Syncopated melodic line, primarily on off-beats. Use rests strategically for rhythmic clarity. Dynamics build to f.
Guitar 2: Sparse, percussive punctuation on strong beats (opposite of Guitar 1). Very detached articulation. Match dynamics at f.
Guitar 3: Flowing eighth-note patterns that weave through the rhythmic interplay below. More legato than the others. Dynamics f, creating a sustained layer above the rhythmic dialogue.

PARTC
Guitar 1: Silent for entire section - creating dramatic contrast.
Guitar 2: Takes the lead with call phrases. Rhythmic and syncopated. Use clear note separation. Dynamics mf-f.
Guitar 3: Responds with sustained, ringing notes that answer Guitar 2. More lyrical phrasing. Dynamics match Guitar 2 but with smoother articulation.

BRIDGE
Guitar 1: Continuous driving pattern - the most active it has been. Propulsive eighth notes with occasional syncopation. Dynamics sustained at f.
Guitar 2: Alternates between sparse punctuation (first half) and more active counterpoint (second half). Dynamic arc from mp to f.
Guitar 3: Mirrors Guitar 1's rhythm in first half with rests, then drops out briefly before returning with sustained notes. Dynamic range mp-f with dramatic contrasts.

OUTRO
Guitar 1: Opens the section with full pattern, then drops out at bar 9. Final sound from this voice. Dynamics fade from f to silence.
Guitar 2: Continues after Guitar 1 drops out, playing through bar 14. Becomes the middle voice in the texture. Dynamics fade from mf to mp to silence.
Guitar 3: The last voice standing, plays through to the end. Final resolution with a sustained high A. Gradual fade from mf to pp, ending with a whisper.
