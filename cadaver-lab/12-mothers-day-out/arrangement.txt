TEMPO: 72 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Emin

INTRO
SPARSE AND INTIMATE. Guitar fingerpicks the Em-C-Em-D pattern.
Voice hums the melody - not words yet, just the shape of what's coming.
No drums, no bass, no piano. Just guitar and breath.
This is the sound of memory before language.

VERSE
ADD BASS on verse 1 - upright, whole notes, roots only.
Brush drums enter on verse 2 - barely there, just shape.
Guitar continues fingerpicking pattern throughout.

Verses 1-2: The memory (Baptist church, conversion van, circle time)
Verses 3-4: The understanding (she needed the quiet, everyone leaves)
Verse 5: The catalog (Ratsun, beach chair, mix tape, beige chickens)

Vocal delivery: Direct, unhurried. Every word lands.
Don't rush "the door, the hall, the room, the window" - let it accumulate.

CHORUS
PIANO ENTERS here - simple, hymn-like chords.
Drums slightly fuller but still brushes.

"Mother's Day Out" - sing it like a name, like a place you've been.
"That's what they called it" - matter-of-fact, not bitter.
"And I'm still learning what it means" - the weight is here.

BRIDGE
THE BUILD. 16 bars of instrumental crescendo.

Bars 1-4: Establish the pattern, guitar and bass and drums.
Bars 5-8: STRINGS ENTER - violin and viola, long tones, swelling.
Bars 9-12: SAXOPHONE ENTERS - joining the strings, not fighting them.
Bars 13-16: Full ensemble, building to the climax verse.

Synth pad underneath everything - warmth, not coldness.
This should feel like remembering everything at once.

VERSE_CLIMAX
EVERYTHING PLAYING. The cathartic verse.

"Charm, self-pity, and rage" - the callback to Track 2
"Cadaver lab where I learned the bones" - callback to Track 1
"Mercury outboard in the morning haze" - callback to Track 6
"Beige chickens in an empty yard" - callback to Track 7

All the people from the album return in images.
"The door, the hall, the room, the window / The car pulling away"
This is the thesis: all knowing begins with separation.

Full band, strings, saxophone, drums with sticks now.
Voice at its strongest, not screaming but PRESENT.

CHORUS_FINAL
CATHARSIS. "That's what we needed / Now I understand"

Not bitter. Not sad. Just true.
The understanding that love and constant presence are different things.
That leaving makes returning possible.

Hold the final "understand" - let it ring.

OUTRO
STRIP EVERYTHING AWAY.

Just guitar and voice return. Maybe one synth pad tone fading.

"Tuesday morning, my hands on her shoulders" - you are now the parent.
"Different church, the same parking lot" - the cycle continues.
"She looks back once, I wave her through the door" - she needs this too.
"And I drive the long way home" - you understand now.

End on the Em. Hold it. Let it ring until it disappears.

PRODUCTION: The silence after the final note is part of the song.
Let it sit for 3-4 seconds before the track ends.
The album should end in silence, not fade.
