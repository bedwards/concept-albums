# LYRICS


VERSE1
Mercury outboard in the morning haze
You taught me how to read the water
Where the current runs, where the bass would be
Without a word between us
Between us

VERSE2
Pull the cord three times, then wait
That's how you said to start the day
The engine caught, the boat moved out
Everything you couldn't say
Couldn't say

VERSE3
Now I hear that engine sometimes
When I'm nowhere near the water
Just the sound of you still teaching
Still your son, still your daughter
Still learning what you taught

VERSE1
Mercury outboard in the morning haze
You taught me how to read the water
Where the current runs, where the bass would be
Without a word between us
Between us

VERSE2
Pull the cord three times, then wait
That's how you said to start the day
The engine caught, the boat moved out
Everything you couldn't say
Couldn't say

VERSE3
Now I hear that engine sometimes
When I'm nowhere near the water
Just the sound of you still teaching
Still your son, still your daughter
Still learning what you taught

CHORUS
Mercury outboard, morning on the lake
That's how you know a person
By the things they cannot say
By what they taught you anyway
