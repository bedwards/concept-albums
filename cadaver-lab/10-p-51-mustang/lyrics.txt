# LYRICS


VERSE1
Model airplane on the shelf
P-51 Mustang, silver paint
He never talked about the war
Just built his models, never complained
Never complained

VERSE2
Medals in the bottom drawer
I found them after he was gone
Purple Heart and Silver Star
Never knew what he had done
What he had done

VERSE3
Sunday mornings at the hangar
Watching planes come in to land
He'd name them all, every model
But never what they were for
What they were for

VERSE4
Now I understand the silence
Was the weight he chose to carry
Protecting us from what he knew
From what made him who he had to be
Had to be

VERSE1
Model airplane on the shelf
P-51 Mustang, silver paint
He never talked about the war
Just built his models, never complained
Never complained

VERSE2
Medals in the bottom drawer
I found them after he was gone
Purple Heart and Silver Star
Never knew what he had done
What he had done

VERSE3
Sunday mornings at the hangar
Watching planes come in to land
He'd name them all, every model
But never what they were for
What they were for

VERSE4
Now I understand the silence
Was the weight he chose to carry
Protecting us from what he knew
From what made him who he had to be
Had to be

CHORUS
P-51 Mustang on the shelf
That's how you know a person
By the silence they protect you with
By what they never said
