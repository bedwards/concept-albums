# LYRICS


VERSE1
Tuesday morning, conversion van
Baptist church, the parking lot
Her hands on my shoulders at the door
Then the door, then the hall, then the room
Then the window where I watched her go


VERSE2
Circle time and finger paint
Graham crackers on a paper plate
Alphabet rug beneath my knees
I knew her car by the sound it made
But that sound didn't come


VERSE3
She drove the long way home alone
Radio off and windows down
Past the Hastings, past the Kroger
Past the sheep farm on the county line
She needed the quiet, I was the noise


VERSE4
My daughter at the same door now
Tuesday morning, her hands on mine
She's got my mother's shoulders
Got my mother's need for quiet
And I drive the long way home


VERSE5
The Ratsun in an empty driveway
Beach chair folded against the rain
Mix tape rewound to the beginning
Beige chickens in an empty yard
That's how you know them, by the space they leave


VERSE1
Tuesday morning, conversion van
Baptist church, the parking lot
Her hands on my shoulders at the door
Then the door, then the hall, then the room
Then the window where I watched her go

Graham crackers on a paper plate
Alphabet rug beneath my knees
I knew her car by the sound it made
But that sound didn't come

Past the Hastings, past the Kroger
Past the sheep farm on the county line
She needed the quiet, I was the noise

Tuesday morning, her hands on mine
She's got my mother's shoulders
Got my mother's need for quiet
And I drive the long way home

Beach chair folded against the rain
Mix tape rewound to the beginning
Beige chickens in an empty yard
That's how you know them, by the space they leave


CHORUS1
Mother's Day Out
Tuesday morning, Baptist church
Mother's Day Out
And I would know you anywhere

VERSE_CLIMAX
Charm, self-pity, and rage
All rotating through a single face
Cadaver lab where I learned the bones
Mercury outboard in the morning haze

Everyone I've memorized
Everyone whose hands I've held
Everyone returns to this
The door, the hall, the room, the window
The car pulling away

CHORUS_FINAL
Mother's Day Out
That's what we needed
Mother's Day Out
Now I understand

OUTRO
Tuesday morning, my hands on her shoulders
Different church, the same parking lot
She looks back once, I wave her through the door
And I drive the long way home
