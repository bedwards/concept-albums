# CHORDS


VERSE1
Em  Am
GCHQ translator, Cheltenham England
C  D
January two-thousand-three, snow on the ground
Em  Am
NSA memo asking for illegal surveillance
C  D
On UN Security Council members' phones


Em  Am
To help America build a case for war
C  D
In Iraq, for weapons that didn't exist

VERSE2
Em  Am
She leaked it to the press, got arrested
C  D
Official Secrets Act, prison time ahead
Em  Am
The government claimed public interest immunity
C  D
To hide the legal advice they'd been given


Em  Am
Then dropped all charges the day trial started
C  D
Rather than admit the war was illegal from the beginning

VERSE3
Em  Am
She went back to work translating languages
C  D
No pension, no job in her field again
Em  Am
Fifteen years later they made a movie
C  D
Keira Knightley playing her quiet defiance


Em  Am
But the dossier was still a lie
C  D
And hundreds of thousands still died

CHORUS1
C  G
One translator in Cheltenham
Am  Em
Against the machinery of war
C  G
The dossier was fiction
Am  Em
But they invaded anyway
