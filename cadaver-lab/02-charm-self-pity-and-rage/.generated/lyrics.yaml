song:
  title: Charm, Self-Pity, and Rage
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - I learned to read the weather
  - In the set of your shoulders at the door
  - Which one would greet me
  - Which one I'd be waiting for
  - Waiting for
  verse2:
  - Sometimes the charm came easy
  - Coffee and a joke and sleeves rolled back
  - The sun was out inside you
  - And I'd forget the other tracks
  - Other tracks
  verse3:
  - Sometimes the pity swallowed
  - Everything the light could reach
  - The world arranged against you
  - And nothing I could say or teach
  - I could teach
  verse4:
  - Sometimes the rage came sudden
  - Slammed doors and inventory of my faults
  - I learned to read the weather
  - I learned to walk on salt
  - Walk on salt
  chorus:
  - Charm, self-pity, and rage
  - All rotating through one face
  - Three weathers, one landscape
  - And I stayed in place
