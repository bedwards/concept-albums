# CHORDS


VERSE1
Dm
I'm tuning to a station that went dark
Bb
Static where your voice used to be
Gm
Frequency shifting, nothing to mark
A
The place where you transmitted to me
Dm  Bb
Glass frequencies, I reach but I can't hold
Gm  A
Every signal that I catch turns cold
Dm

Dm


VERSE2
Dm
The dial spins but there's nothing left
Bb
Just the hum of what we used to say
Gm
I'm holding onto hollow frequencies
A
Watching them decay
Dm  Bb
Glass frequencies, I reach but I can't hold
Gm  A
Every wavelength that I touch turns cold
Dm

Dm


CHORUS
Dm  Bb
Signal decay, signal decay
Gm  A
I'm reaching through the static for your face
Dm  Bb
Signal decay, signal decay
Gm  A
Nothing but the echo of this place
