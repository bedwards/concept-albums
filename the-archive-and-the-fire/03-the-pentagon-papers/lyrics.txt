# LYRICS


VERSE1
RAND Corporation analyst, top secret clearance
Reading seven thousand pages of Vietnam's truth
Four presidents lied to the public
About a war they knew we'd lose

He Xeroxed every page at night
His kids helping collate the proof
First he tried the Senate, then the Times
Nineteen-seventy-one, the truth broke loose

VERSE2
Nixon called him the most dangerous man
In America, enemy of the state
Broke into his psychiatrist's office
Looking for dirt to discredit his name

Espionage Act, hundred and fifteen years
Facing prison for telling what's true
Then Watergate broke and the case collapsed
Government misconduct set him free

VERSE3
He spent the next forty years speaking
Against every war that came around
Got arrested at the Pentagon at eighty-five
Still saying what shouldn't be allowed

He told Chelsea Manning she did right
He told Snowden he'd done the same
Said the only thing he regretted
Was waiting so long to release those papers

VERSE4
Died in twenty-twenty-three at ninety-two
Watching another generation wake
To the pattern he tried to break
Fifty years too late

But the Pentagon Papers are still online
Supreme Court ruled they could be read
And now you know what he knew in seventy-one
That presidents lie and soldiers bleed

CHORUS1
Seven thousand pages
Of what they knew and hid
The war was lost before it started
But they sent the soldiers anyway
