# CHORDS


VERSE1
Em
Beige chickens in the morning
C
Same birds every day
G  D
Pecking at the gravel
Em
In the same deliberate way
C  G
Deliberate way
Em


VERSE2
Em
She counted them like rosary beads
C
Before she'd go inside
G  D
Well-proportioned birds she called them
Em
Some small farmer's pride
C  G
Farmer's pride
Em


VERSE3
Em
I'd watch her from the kitchen
C
Coffee going cold
G  D
The way she'd talk to every one
Em
Stories never told
C  G
Never told to anyone but them
Em

CHORUS
Em  G
Beige chickens in an ordinary yard
C  D
That's how you know someone

By the ordinary things they tend
C  D
By the ordinary things they've done

VERSE_CLIMAX
Em
The coop stands empty now
C
The feed bin rusted through
G  D
The yard grown over with weeds
Em
But I carry what she knew
C  G
Everything she knew


Em
How to tend the ordinary
C
How to love what doesn't last
G  D
How to count your blessings daily
Em
Like beige chickens in the grass
C  D
In the grass
