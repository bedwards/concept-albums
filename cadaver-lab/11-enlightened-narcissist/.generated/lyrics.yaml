song:
  title: Enlightened Narcissist
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - You knew every wound you carried
  - Named them all with therapy words
  - Attachment style and trauma bond
  - Your damage perfectly rehearsed
  - Perfectly rehearsed
  verse2:
  - You warned me what you'd do to me
  - Before you did it anyway
  - As if the knowing absolved you
  - Of every single thing you'd say
  - Thing you'd say
  verse3:
  - I'm working on myself you said
  - While working me into the ground
  - The language of growth and healing
  - Just another way to wound
  - Way to wound
  verse4:
  - Now I hear those words different
  - When someone's too fluent in pain
  - When they know their whole diagnosis
  - But never seem to change
  - Never change
  chorus:
  - Enlightened narcissist
  - That's how I know you now
  - By the therapy you weaponized
  - By how you never came around
  chorus_final:
  - Enlightened narcissist
  - That's how I know you now
  - By the therapy you weaponized
  - I see you and you see me seeing
