# LYRICS


VERSE1
GCHQ translator, Cheltenham England
January two-thousand-three, snow on the ground
NSA memo asking for illegal surveillance
On UN Security Council members' phones

To help America build a case for war
In Iraq, for weapons that didn't exist

VERSE2
She leaked it to the press, got arrested
Official Secrets Act, prison time ahead
The government claimed public interest immunity
To hide the legal advice they'd been given

Then dropped all charges the day trial started
Rather than admit the war was illegal from the beginning

VERSE3
She went back to work translating languages
No pension, no job in her field again
Fifteen years later they made a movie
Keira Knightley playing her quiet defiance

But the dossier was still a lie
And hundreds of thousands still died

CHORUS1
One translator in Cheltenham
Against the machinery of war
The dossier was fiction
But they invaded anyway
