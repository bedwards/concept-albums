# LYRICS


VERSE1
Daddy ran the crew
Grease under every hand
Son you'll take my place
I saw the boss's face

VERSE2
Whistle blows at six
Same broken machines
Tighten the belt they say
Withheld wages cry out

VERSE3
Picket line on Commerce
Every hand I meet
Don't muzzle the ox
They locked us out

CHORUS1
I'm the foreman's son but I'm standing with you
Brothers and sisters we know what's true
They can't divide us anymore
The foreman's son just joined the floor

VERSE1
Daddy ran the crew
Grease under every hand
Son you'll take my place
I saw the boss's face

VERSE2
Whistle blows at six
Same broken machines
Tighten the belt they say
Withheld wages cry out

VERSE3
Picket line on Commerce
Every hand I meet
Don't muzzle the ox
They locked us out

CHORUS1
I'm the foreman's son but I'm standing with you
Brothers and sisters we know what's true
They can't divide us anymore
The foreman's son just joined the floor

BRIDGE1
Daddy won't speak now
Says I broke the vow
Christ brought the sword
To divide the house

VERSE1
Daddy ran the crew
Grease under every hand
Son you'll take my place
I saw the boss's face

VERSE2
Whistle blows at six
Same broken machines
Tighten the belt they say
Withheld wages cry out

VERSE3
Picket line on Commerce
Every hand I meet
Don't muzzle the ox
They locked us out

CHORUS1
I'm the foreman's son but I'm standing with you
Brothers and sisters we know what's true
They can't divide us anymore
The foreman's son just joined the floor

OUTRO1
We all got the grease under our hands
And the Lord hears the cry of the workingman
We all got the grease under our hands
James 5 says your riches have rotted where they stand
