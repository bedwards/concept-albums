  verse1:
  - Daddy ran the crew
  - Grease under every hand
  - Son you'll take my place
  - I saw the boss's face
  verse2:
  - Whistle blows at six
  - Same broken machines
  - Tighten the belt they say
  - Withheld wages cry out

  - Picket line on Commerce
  - Every hand I meet
  - Don't muzzle the ox
  - They locked us out

  - I'm the foreman's son but I'm standing with you
  - Brothers and sisters we know what's true
  - They can't divide us anymore
  - The foreman's son just joined the floor

  - Daddy won't speak now
  - Says I broke the vow
  - Christ brought the sword
  - To divide the house
  outro1:
  - We all got the grease under our hands
  - And the Lord hears the cry of the workingman
  - We all got the grease under our hands
  - James 5 says your riches have rotted where they stand
