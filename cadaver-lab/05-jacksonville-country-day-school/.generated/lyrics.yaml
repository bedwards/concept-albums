song:
  title: Jacksonville Country Day School
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Khaki pants and polo shirts
  - Carpool line at seven thirty
  - Learning how to hold your face
  - When everything inside feels dirty
  - Feels dirty
  verse2:
  - You told me once about the cafeteria
  - Where you learned to eat alone
  - How the laughter sounded different
  - When it wasn't aimed at anyone you'd known
  - Anyone you'd known
  verse3:
  - The conversion van that picked you up
  - Your mother in the driver's seat
  - She never asked about your day
  - Just drove in silence down the street
  - Down the street
  verse4:
  - Now I understand the armor
  - That you learned to wear so young
  - The way you hold your shoulders back
  - The way you swallow everything unsung
  - Everything unsung
  chorus:
  - Jacksonville Country Day
  - That's where you learned to disappear
  - I know you by what you don't say
  - By the silence you still wear
