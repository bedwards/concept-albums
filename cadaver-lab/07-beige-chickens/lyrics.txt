# LYRICS


VERSE1
Beige chickens in the morning
Same birds every day
Pecking at the gravel
In the same deliberate way
Deliberate way


VERSE2
She counted them like rosary beads
Before she'd go inside
Well-proportioned birds she called them
Some small farmer's pride
Farmer's pride


VERSE3
She'd park my front door open
So I could watch her there
The way she'd talk to every one
Stories in the morning air
Never told to anyone but them

Pecking at the gravel
In the same deliberate way

VERSE2
She counted them like rosary beads
Before she'd go inside
Well-proportioned birds she called them
Some small farmer's pride
Farmer's pride


VERSE3
She'd park my front door open
So I could watch her there
The way she'd talk to every one
Stories in the morning air
Never told to anyone but them


CHORUS
Beige chickens in an ordinary yard
That's how you know someone
By the ordinary things they tend
By the ordinary things they've done

VERSE_CLIMAX
The coop stands empty now
The feed bin rusted through
The yard grown over with weeds
But I carry what she knew
Everything she knew

How to tend the ordinary
How to love what doesn't last
How to count your blessings daily
Like beige chickens in the grass
In the grass

CHORUS_FINAL
Beige chickens in an ordinary yard
That's how you know someone
By the ordinary things they tend
By the ordinary things they've done
What they've done
What they've done
