TEMPO: 74 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Emin

INTRO
GUITAR ALONE. Morning light. The sound of ordinary.
Fingerpicked Em-C-G-D pattern. Patient, domestic.
This is the longest buildup on the album - earn every instrument.

VERSE
BASS ENTERS verse 1 - upright, whole notes.
Brushes enter verse 2 - the rhythm of daily routine.

Verse 1: The chickens themselves - "same birds every day"
Verse 2: The person - "counted them like rosary beads"
Verse 3: What you witnessed - "stories never told to anyone but them"

Vocal delivery: Patient, observational. Not nostalgic yet.
"Well-proportioned birds she called them" - her phrase, exact.
"Stories never told" - the privacy of small routines.

CHORUS
PIANO ENTERS - hymn-like, supporting.
Drums fuller but still brushes.

"That's how you know someone / By the ordinary things they tend"
This is the album's central insight: knowing through attention to the small.

BRIDGE
THE BUILD. 16 bars. This is the BCNR moment.

Bars 1-4: Establish the pattern, guitar bass drums piano.
Bars 5-8: STRINGS ENTER - violin and viola, ascending.
Bars 9-12: SAXOPHONE ENTERS - weaving with strings.
Bars 13-16: ELECTRIC GUITAR ENTERS - clean, not distorted. Full ensemble.

This should feel like remembering everything at once.
Like suddenly understanding what those mornings meant.
The crescendo is emotional, not just sonic.

VERSE_CLIMAX
EVERYTHING PLAYING. Full band, strings, sax, electric guitar.

"The coop stands empty now" - the turn to absence.
"How to love what doesn't last" - the lesson.
"Like beige chickens in the grass" - the image returns, transformed.

Voice at its strongest. Saxophone swells underneath.
This is the cathartic peak of the middle of the album.

CHORUS_FINAL
FULL CATHARSIS. "What they've done" repeated - incantation.

Hold the final Em. Let everything ring together.
This is what knowing someone sounds like: full and fragile.

OUTRO
STRIP BACK DRAMATICALLY.
Drums stop. Electric guitar stops. Sax stops.
Strings thin to single violin note, then silence.
Piano drops. Bass drops.
Just guitar, returning to the opening pattern.
Final Em chord. Let it ring 4-5 seconds.

PRODUCTION NOTES:
- This is the centerpiece of the album. ~6:30.
- The build must be EARNED. Don't rush the early verses.
- When the sax enters, it should feel like revelation.
- "Well-proportioned" - use the phrase naturally, don't force it.
- The chickens are real. The person was real. Honor that.
