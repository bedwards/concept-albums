# CHORDS


VERSE1
G  C
My grandfather kept a locked drawer
G  D
Full of things he never showed
G  C
Letters from the union hall
G  D  G
Names of men the bosses chose


G  C
He said son there's a difference clear
G  D
Between the ones who talk and act
G  C
Between the knowing and the doing
G  D  G
Between the forward and the back

VERSE2
G  C
I found his papers when he died
G  D
Mimeographed and coffee-stained
G  C
Meetings held in basements dark
G  D  G
Every single name erased


G  C
Not for glory or for fame
G  D
Not for history's gentle hand
G  C
Just because the work was there
G  D  G
Just because they took a stand

VERSE3
G  C
There's a server farm in Iceland
G  D
Holding terabytes of truth
G  C
Documents that powerful men
G  D  G
Would kill to keep from you


G  C
Someone risked their life for this
G  D
Someone chose the harder road
G  C
You'll never know their name or face
G  D  G
But you're holding what they chose

VERSE4
G  C
Tonight I'm in my kitchen late
G  D
Reading what I shouldn't read
G  C
Tomorrow I could forward this
G  D  G
Or let it die with me


G  C
My children sleeping down the hall
G  D
My job waiting in the morning
G  C
The locked drawer in my desk
G  D  G
Already calling

CHORUS1
Em  C
This is what we inherit
G  D
The weight of choosing right
Em  C
Not the glory or the story
G  D
Just the choice we make tonight


Em  C
This is what we're given
G  D
What the ones before us left
Em  C
Not a name carved in marble
G  D  G
Just the locked drawer in the desk
