/intro/
Na na naaa, na na na, na naa naa naaaa
Na na naaa, na na na, na naa naa naaaa

/verse-1/
She left me standing at the station
With nothing but my pride
I watched the train pull out of Texas
And something in me died

/chorus/
They say the road will ease the hurting
Because the miles wash it clean
But the road forgot to take her memory
Yes the road forgot to take her memory

/verse-2/
I drove down through the desert valley
Past the Rio Grande
I saw a woman in the distance
With a baby on her hand

/verse-3/
I pulled my truck up to the farmhouse
And stepped out in the heat
She looked at me with my own daughter
Standing at her feet

/chorus/
They say the road will ease the hurting
Because the miles wash it clean
But the road forgot to take her memory
Yes the road forgot to take her memory

/verse-4/
The little girl she asked me questions
Like where I'd been so long
I couldn't tell her I'd been running
From everything gone wrong

/verse-5/
I knelt beside my little angel
And held her tiny hands
I said your mama loved you truly
More than you'll understand

/outro/
She said the road will ease the hurting
Because the miles wash it clean
Na na naaa, na na na, na naa naa naaaa
Na na naaa, na na na, na naa naa naaaa
