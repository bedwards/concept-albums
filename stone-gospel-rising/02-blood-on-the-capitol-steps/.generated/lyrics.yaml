  title: Blood on the Capitol Steps
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Pink granite in the sun
  - Vote is done
  - Woe to those who decree unjust laws
  - Blood on the capitol floor
  verse2:
  - When you turned the hungry away
  - You turned him away
  - Every stolen wage cries out
  - Depart I never knew you
  verse3:
  - He overturned the tables once
  - Drove the money changers out
  - You made his house a den again
  - He's coming back to cleanse
  verse4:
  - You devour widows' houses
  - Make long prayers for show
  - Whitewashed tombs full of bones
  - He called you out long ago
  verse5:
  - You shut the kingdom's door
  - Won't enter won't let them in
  - Strain out gnats swallow camels
  - Justice mercy faith left to die
  verse6:
  - The stones are crying out
  - If they stay silent now
  - The rocks will tell what you have done
  - Pink granite stained with blood
  outro:
  - The stones cry out
