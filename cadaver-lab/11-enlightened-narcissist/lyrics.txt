# LYRICS


VERSE1
You knew every wound you carried
Named them all with therapy words
Attachment style and trauma bond
Your damage perfectly rehearsed
Perfectly rehearsed

VERSE2
You warned me what you'd do to me
Before you did it anyway
As if the knowing absolved you
Of every single thing you'd say
Thing you'd say

VERSE3
I'm working on myself you said
While working me into the ground
The language of growth and healing
Just another way to wound
Way to wound

VERSE4
Now I hear those words different
When someone's too fluent in pain
When they know their whole diagnosis
But never seem to change
Never change

VERSE1
You knew every wound you carried
Named them all with therapy words
Attachment style and trauma bond
Your damage perfectly rehearsed
Perfectly rehearsed

VERSE2
You warned me what you'd do to me
Before you did it anyway
As if the knowing absolved you
Of every single thing you'd say
Thing you'd say

VERSE3
I'm working on myself you said
While working me into the ground
The language of growth and healing
Just another way to wound
Way to wound

VERSE4
Now I hear those words different
When someone's too fluent in pain
When they know their whole diagnosis
But never seem to change
Never change

CHORUS
Enlightened narcissist
Attachment style and trauma bond
Enlightened narcissist
And I would know you anywhere
