song:
  title: P-51 Mustang
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Model airplane on the shelf
  - P-51 Mustang, silver paint
  - He never talked about the war
  - Just built his models, never complained
  - Never complained
  verse2:
  - Medals in the bottom drawer
  - I found them after he was gone
  - Purple Heart and Silver Star
  - Never knew what he had done
  - What he had done
  verse3:
  - Sunday mornings at the hangar
  - Watching planes come in to land
  - He'd name them all, every model
  - But never what they were for
  - What they were for
  verse4:
  - I build the model now myself
  - Silver paint and glue that stings
  - My hands shake where his stayed steady
  - Steady through everything, through everything
  - Through everything
  chorus:
  - P-51 Mustang, P-51
  - Silver paint and silence
  - P-51 Mustang, P-51
  - And I would know you anywhere
