# CHORDS


VERSE1
G
Mercury outboard in the morning haze
C
You taught me how to read the water
Em  D
Where the current runs, where the bass would be
G
Without a word between us
C  G
Between us

VERSE2
G
Pull the cord three times, then wait
C
That's how you said to start the day
Em  D
The engine caught, the boat moved out
G
Everything you couldn't say
C  G
Couldn't say

VERSE3
G
Barton Springs lifeguard, summer of seventy-three
C
That's where you learned to read the water
Em  D
Just the sound of you still teaching
G
Still your son, still your daughter
C  G
Still learning what you taught

Still learning what you taught

CHORUS
G  C
Mercury outboard, morning on the lake
Em  D
That's how you know a person
G  C
By the things they cannot say
D  G
By what they taught you anyway
