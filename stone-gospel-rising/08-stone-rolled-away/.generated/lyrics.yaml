song:
  title: Stone Rolled Away
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Roman stone sealed tight
  - Guards at the gate
  - Bury what threatens the throne
  - Women came at dawn
  verse2:
  - Mary first to see
  - The lynched one risen
  - Rich men wanted underground
  - Can't keep resurrection bound
  verse3:
  - When they seal the door
  - Say the uprising's over
  - Friday wasn't the end
  - Sunday coming
  chorus:
  - Stone rolled away
  - Stone rolled away
  - He is not here
  - Guards ran in fear
  - Death couldn't hold
  - What the powerful killed
  build1:
  - Every empire falls
  - Every Pharaoh dies
  - The stone keeps rolling
  - Crushing what it strikes
  outro:
  - Stone keeps rolling
  - Can't stop what's risen
  - Stone keeps rolling
  - Rejected stone chosen
  - Rolling through Texas tonight
  - Walking in resurrection light
