TEMPO: 72 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Emin

INTRO
GUITAR AND PEDAL STEEL. The sound of memory.
Slow, patient. Em minor for weight.

VERSE
BASS ENTERS verse 1, brushes verse 2.
MUTED TRUMPET enters bridge - taps-adjacent, military.

Verse 1: The model - "P-51 Mustang, silver paint"
Verse 2: The medals - "found them after he was gone"
Verse 3: The ritual - "Sunday mornings at the hangar"
Verse 4: Understanding - "the weight he chose to carry"

Vocal delivery: Reverent, grateful.
"Never knew what he had done" - wonder, not accusation.

CHORUS
TRUMPET joins second chorus, muted, distant.
"By the silence they protect you with" - the thesis.

BRIDGE
TRUMPET SOLO. Not triumphant - mournful.
The sound of what couldn't be said.
Pedal steel underneath, crying.

OUTRO
TRUMPET FADES first - like taps ending.
Pedal steel and guitar remain, then fade.
Final Em chord. Let it ring.
~4:45. Reverent, sad, grateful.
