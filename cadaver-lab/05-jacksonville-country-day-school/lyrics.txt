# LYRICS


VERSE1
Khaki pants and polo shirts
Carpool line at seven thirty
Learning how to hold your face
When everything inside feels dirty
Feels dirty

VERSE2
You told me once about the cafeteria
Where you learned to eat alone
How the laughter sounded different
When it wasn't aimed at anyone you'd known
Anyone you'd known

VERSE3
The conversion van that picked you up
Your mother in the driver's seat
She never asked about your day
Just drove in silence down the street
Down the street

VERSE4
You still flinch at cafeterias
Still count the exits in a room
Your shoulders carry something old
Your spine holds the shape of Tuesday afternoon
Tuesday afternoon

VERSE1
Khaki pants and polo shirts
Carpool line at seven thirty
Learning how to hold your face
When everything inside feels dirty
Feels dirty

VERSE2
You told me once about the cafeteria
Where you learned to eat alone
How the laughter sounded different
When it wasn't aimed at anyone you'd known
Anyone you'd known

VERSE3
The conversion van that picked you up
Your mother in the driver's seat
She never asked about your day
Just drove in silence down the street
Down the street

VERSE4
You still flinch at cafeterias
Still count the exits in a room
Your shoulders carry something old
Your spine holds the shape of Tuesday afternoon
Tuesday afternoon

CHORUS
Jacksonville Country Day
Khaki pants and carpool lane
Jacksonville Country Day
And I would know you anywhere

VERSE1
Khaki pants and polo shirts
Carpool line at seven thirty
Learning how to hold your face
When everything inside feels dirty
Feels dirty

VERSE2
You told me once about the cafeteria
Where you learned to eat alone
How the laughter sounded different
When it wasn't aimed at anyone you'd known
Anyone you'd known

VERSE3
The conversion van that picked you up
Your mother in the driver's seat
She never asked about your day
Just drove in silence down the street
Down the street

VERSE4
You still flinch at cafeterias
Still count the exits in a room
Your shoulders carry something old
Your spine holds the shape of Tuesday afternoon
Tuesday afternoon

CHORUS
Jacksonville Country Day
Khaki pants and carpool lane
Jacksonville Country Day
And I would know you anywhere

When everything inside feels dirty

When it wasn't aimed at anyone you'd known
