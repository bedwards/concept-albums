TEMPO: 88 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Cmin

INTRO
Dark, foreboding. Pump organ sustains Cm. Bass whole notes. Drums steady quarter notes.
Building dread - something is about to be said.

VERSE
SERMON FORMAT - verse-only, no chorus, relentless accusation.
Each verse builds intensity but never releases into a chorus.
Sparse. Acoustic fingerpicks on chord changes only. Electric silent.
Bass root-fifth walk, prominent. Drums backbeat 2 & 4.
Vocal almost spoken-sung, like reading charges in court.
Verses 1-3: measured, declarative. Verses 4-6: building righteous anger.
No breaks, no relief - unrelenting prophetic condemnation.

OUTRO
Sudden drop, menacing. Vocal dry and close on "stones cry out".
End on Gm power chord, hold, then cut dead. No fade.
The silence after is the verdict.
