# CHORDS


VERSE1
Bm
You knew every wound you carried
G
Named them all with therapy words
A  Em
Attachment style and trauma bond
Bm
Your damage perfectly rehearsed
G  Bm
Perfectly rehearsed

VERSE2
Bm
You warned me what you'd do to me
G
Before you did it anyway
A  Em
As if the knowing absolved you
Bm
Of every single thing you'd say
G  Bm
Thing you'd say

VERSE3
Bm
I'm working on myself you said
G
While working me into the ground
A  Em
The language of growth and healing
Bm
Just another way to wound
G  Bm
Way to wound

VERSE4
Bm
Now I hear those words different
G
When someone's too fluent in pain
A  Em
When they know their whole diagnosis
Bm
But never seem to change
G  Bm
Never change
