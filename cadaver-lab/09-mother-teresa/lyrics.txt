# LYRICS


VERSE1
She runs the half marathon every spring
Makes sure everyone can see
The photographs, the Facebook posts
A saint for all to be
All to see

VERSE2
I know why she needs the witness
I've seen the house she grew up in
The way her mother counted kindness
Kept a ledger of her sins
Of her sins

VERSE3
Disc golf league and open mic host
She organized it all
Mother Teresa, they called her once
She laughed but I saw her flinch
Saw her flinch

VERSE4
Now I hold her contradictions
Like I hold all the rest
The need to be seen being good
Is just another wound undressed
Wound undressed

VERSE1
She runs the half marathon every spring
Makes sure everyone can see
The photographs, the Facebook posts
A saint for all to be
All to see

VERSE2
I know why she needs the witness
I've seen the house she grew up in
The way her mother counted kindness
Kept a ledger of her sins
Of her sins

VERSE3
Disc golf league and open mic host
She organized it all
Mother Teresa, they called her once
She laughed but I saw her flinch
Saw her flinch

VERSE4
Now I hold her contradictions
Like I hold all the rest
The need to be seen being good
Is just another wound undressed
Wound undressed

CHORUS
Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa
Cabo Bob's on a Tuesday night
Mother Teresa, Mother Teresa
And I would know you anywhere
