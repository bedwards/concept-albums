# LYRICS


VERSE1
Rio running low
Footprints in dust
Mother carries water
Love the stranger

VERSE2
Guard at the border
Orders written down
He remembered that night
Christ a refugee

VERSE3
Morning on the mountains
Stranger at the gate
You were strangers once
River still remains

CHORUS
I was a stranger
You turned me away
One law for all
You built the wall

VERSE1
Rio running low
Footprints in dust
Mother carries water
Love the stranger

VERSE2
Guard at the border
Orders written down
He remembered that night
Christ a refugee

VERSE3
Morning on the mountains
Stranger at the gate
You were strangers once
River still remains

CHORUS
I was a stranger
You turned me away
One law for all
You built the wall

BRIDGE
Herod wanted the child dead
So Joseph took his family and fled
Egypt welcomed what Bethlehem rejected
Every refused refugee is Christ redirected

VERSE1
Rio running low
Footprints in dust
Mother carries water
Love the stranger

VERSE2
Guard at the border
Orders written down
He remembered that night
Christ a refugee

VERSE3
Morning on the mountains
Stranger at the gate
You were strangers once
River still remains

CHORUS
I was a stranger
You turned me away
One law for all
You built the wall

OUTRO
The river keeps flowing
Can't wall away what God is showing
The river keeps flowing
Whatever you did to the least
You did it to me
