# CHORDS


VERSE1
C
You made me a mix tape once
Am
Handwritten track list, blue ink
F  G
Pulp Fiction on the first side
C
Whatever you were trying to tell me
Am  C
I think

VERSE2
C
We drove to Hastings to find the songs
Am
Before everything went digital
F  G
You in the aisles with your list
C
Building something ritual
Am  C
Ritual

VERSE3
C
Now I hear those songs on shuffle
Am
And the sequence is all wrong
F  G
You had something to tell me
C
In the order of those songs
Am  C
Those songs

CHORUS
C  Am
Mix tape in a shoebox
F  G
That's how you know a person
C  Am
By the songs they give you
F  C
By what they thought you needed to learn
