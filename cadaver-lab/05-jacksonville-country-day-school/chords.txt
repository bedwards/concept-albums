# CHORDS


VERSE1
Em
Khaki pants and polo shirts
Am
Carpool line at seven thirty
C  D
Learning how to hold your face
Em
When everything inside feels dirty
Am  Em
Feels dirty

VERSE2
Em
You told me once about the cafeteria
Am
Where you learned to eat alone
C  D
How the laughter sounded different
Em
When it wasn't aimed at anyone you'd known
Am  Em
Anyone you'd known

VERSE3
Em
The conversion van that picked you up
Am
Your mother in the driver's seat
C  D
She never asked about your day
Em
Just drove in silence down the street
Am  Em
Down the street

VERSE4
Em
You still flinch at cafeterias
Am
Still count the exits in a room
C  D
Your shoulders carry something old
Em
Your spine holds the shape of Tuesday afternoon
Am  Em
Tuesday afternoon

And I would know you anywhere
