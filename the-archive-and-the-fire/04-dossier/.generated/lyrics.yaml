song:
  title: Dossier (Katherine Gun)
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - GCHQ translator, Cheltenham England
  - January two-thousand-three, snow on the ground
  - NSA memo asking for illegal surveillance
  - On UN Security Council members' phones
  - ''
  - To help America build a case for war
  - In Iraq, for weapons that didn't exist
  verse2:
  - She leaked it to the press, got arrested
  - Official Secrets Act, prison time ahead
  - The government claimed public interest immunity
  - To hide the legal advice they'd been given
  - ''
  - Then dropped all charges the day trial started
  - Rather than admit the war was illegal from the beginning
  verse3:
  - She went back to work translating languages
  - No pension, no job in her field again
  - Fifteen years later they made a movie
  - Keira Knightley playing her quiet defiance
  - ''
  - But the dossier was still a lie
  - And hundreds of thousands still died
  chorus1:
  - One translator in Cheltenham
  - Against the machinery of war
  - The dossier was fiction
  - But they invaded anyway
