# Intertwined

An exploration of contrapuntal guitar melodies where two voices weave together, creating intricate patterns through their interplay.

## Concept

This album explores the conversation between two acoustic guitars, each playing complete melodic lines that make sense independently but create something greater when heard together. The focus is on melodic counterpoint rather than harmonic accompaniment - two paths that cross, diverge, respond, and ultimately move as one.

## Musical Approach

- **Instrumentation**: Two acoustic guitars (fingerstyle)
- **Technique**: Intricate melodic lines, no block chords
- **Style**: Contemporary fingerstyle, melodic counterpoint
- **Focus**: The space between the notes, the conversation between voices

## Track Listing

1. Two Rivers (3:00) - An exploration of two melodic lines flowing together like converging streams
