VERSE1
Pump jack bowing
Basin soaked in blood
Black gold rising
Can't keep what you build

VERSE2
Refinery burning
Odessa skyline orange
Chemical river runs
Water will have its day

VERSE3
Pipeline cuts the ranch
Granddad's land is gone
Call it Texas pride
Earth mourns and withers

CHORUS1
Drill down drill down into the earth
Extract extract for all you're worth
But the land is the Lord's says Psalm 24
And the stones will testify what you ignored

What you hoard rusts away
James chapter 5 verse 3
Your silver corrodes as a witness against you
The earth groans Romans 8:22

The land keeps score
Romans 8 says all creation is groaning
