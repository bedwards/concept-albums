# LYRICS


VERSE1
The sun cuts low through the windshield glass
Another town that I drove right past
The radio fades at the county line
Just static now where the stations whine
Grain elevators standing tall
Casting shadows through the fall
Every mile feels like a prayer
For something waiting out there

VERSE2
The diners close by nine PM
The same old faces, the same old hymns
Sunday morning, Monday's weight
This highway don't negotiate
I called you from a payphone booth
The last one standing, that's the truth
Your voice came through like yesterday
Then the quarters ran out anyway

CHORUS
On the midwest meridian
Where the sky meets the dirt
Every crossroad's a question
Of staying or getting hurt
I keep chasing that horizon
Like it owes me something still
On the midwest meridian
I probably always will

Where the sky meets the dirt

Of staying or getting hurt
I keep chasing that horizon
Like it owes me something still

BRIDGE
Maybe home ain't a place you find
Maybe it's just the road behind
All those miles I left back there
Scattered like seeds in the summer air

CHORUS_FINAL
On the midwest meridian
Where the sky meets the dirt
Every crossroad's a question
Of staying or getting hurt
I keep chasing that horizon
Like it owes me something still
On the midwest meridian
I probably always will
