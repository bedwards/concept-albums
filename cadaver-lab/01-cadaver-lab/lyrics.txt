# LYRICS


VERSE1
I would know you in a lineup of the dead
Know you by the bones that hold your hands
The vertebrae that curve just so
The way your skull remembers every blow
Every blow


VERSE2
I learned this in the cadaver lab
Where students name the hidden parts
The way a rib cage opens
Like a cabinet, like a cart
Like a cart


VERSE3
I've memorized the rhythm
Of your footsteps on the stairs
The specific weight you carry
The particular shade of air
Shade of air when you're there


VERSE4
There's a drawer of your teeth somewhere
In a building I've never seen
A technician labels the box
And I'd know them in a lineup
In a lineup of a thousand


VERSE1
I would know you in a lineup of the dead
Know you by the bones that hold your hands
The vertebrae that curve just so
The way your skull remembers every blow
Every blow


VERSE2
I learned this in the cadaver lab
Where students name the hidden parts
The way a rib cage opens
Like a cabinet, like a cart
Like a cart


VERSE3
I've memorized the rhythm
Of your footsteps on the stairs
The specific weight you carry
The particular shade of air
Shade of air when you're there


VERSE4
There's a drawer of your teeth somewhere
In a building I've never seen
A technician labels the box
And I'd know them in a lineup
In a lineup of a thousand


CHORUS
Cadaver lab, cadaver lab
I would know you anywhere
Cadaver lab, cadaver lab
I would know you by your teeth in the ground

VERSE1
I would know you in a lineup of the dead
Know you by the bones that hold your hands
The vertebrae that curve just so
The way your skull remembers every blow
Every blow


VERSE2
I learned this in the cadaver lab
Where students name the hidden parts
The way a rib cage opens
Like a cabinet, like a cart
Like a cart


VERSE3
I've memorized the rhythm
Of your footsteps on the stairs
The specific weight you carry
The particular shade of air
Shade of air when you're there


VERSE4
There's a drawer of your teeth somewhere
In a building I've never seen
A technician labels the box
And I'd know them in a lineup
In a lineup of a thousand


CHORUS
Cadaver lab, cadaver lab
I would know you anywhere
Cadaver lab, cadaver lab
I would know you by your teeth in the ground

VERSE1
I would know you in a lineup of the dead
Know you by the bones that hold your hands
The vertebrae that curve just so
The way your skull remembers every blow
Every blow

Where students name the hidden parts
The way a rib cage opens
Like a cabinet, like a cart
Like a cart

Of your footsteps on the stairs
The specific weight you carry
The particular shade of air
Shade of air when you're there

In a building I've never seen
A technician labels the box
And I'd know them in a lineup
In a lineup of a thousand


CHORUS_FINAL
Cadaver lab, cadaver lab
I would know you anywhere
Cadaver lab, cadaver lab
I would know you by your silence in the air
