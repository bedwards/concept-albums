TEMPO: 78 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Emin

INTRO
STRINGS ALONE. No guitar, no drums. Violin, viola, cello.
Establishing the weight before words arrive.
This is the sound of studying someone before you speak about them.
Long tones, breathing together, Em to C to Em to D.
Like an orchestra tuning to a feeling instead of a note.

VERSE
GUITAR ENTERS on verse 1 - fingerpicked, patient.
Bass enters quietly - upright, whole notes.
Strings sustain long tones underneath.

Verse 1: The claim - "I would know you in a lineup of the dead"
Verse 2: Where I learned - "cadaver lab"
Verse 3: The specific knowledge - "footsteps on the stairs"
Verse 4: What I carry now - "like water, like a frequency"

Vocal delivery: Unhurried. Almost speaking.
"The vertebrae that curve just so" - let "just so" hang.
"Like a cabinet, like a cart" - medical precision, not morbid.

BRUSHES enter verse 2, barely there.

CHORUS
PIANO ENTERS - simple, hymn-like.
Drums fuller but still brushes.
Strings swell slightly.

"That's how I know you / That's how I know"
Repetition as incantation.

"By the architecture / And the spaces where you've been"
The thesis: knowing = structure + absence.

BRIDGE
INSTRUMENTAL BUILD. 12 bars.
Strings ascend. Piano octave higher.
Drums add hi-hat, more energy.
Guitar continues pattern but strumming now, not fingerpicking.

Building toward the final verse and chorus.

CHORUS_FINAL
FULL ENSEMBLE. Everything playing.
"And the spaces where WE'VE been" - the shift from "you" to "we"
Now the knowing is mutual.

Voice at its strongest, but controlled.
Not screaming - PRESENT.

OUTRO
GRADUAL FADE. Not sudden.
Drums stop first.
Bass drops out.
Piano gone.
Guitar and strings thin.
Finally just guitar, then just the final Em chord.

Let it ring. 3-4 seconds of silence before the track ends.
This sets the tone for the whole album: patient, attentive, willing to wait.
