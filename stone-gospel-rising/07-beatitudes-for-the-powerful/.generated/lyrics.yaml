song:
  title: Beatitudes for the Powerful
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Blessed are the poor in spirit
  - You got mansions offshore accounts
  - Blessed are those who mourn
  - You criminalize their grief
  verse2:
  - Blessed are the merciful
  - Prison empire El Paso
  - Blessed are the pure in heart
  - Your hands stained with blood
  verse3:
  - Blessed are the peacemakers
  - You profit from the wars
  - Blessed the persecuted
  - You persecute the righteous
  chorus:
  - These beatitudes
  - Turned back on you
  - Blessed the meek you pushed aside
  - Woe to you who lead
  - Whitewashed tombs
  - Blessings for the humble
  - Woes for the proud
  - Hear the woes out loud
  bridge:
  - Woe to you scribes and Pharisees
  - You shut heaven's door
  - Lock it in their faces
  - While you walk free
  - Woe devour widows' houses
  - Long prayers for show
  - Strain out gnats
  - Swallow camels whole
  outro:
  - Blessed are the poor
  - Woe to the rich who ignore
  - Same sermon same Lord
  - One blessing one warning
  - Which one you listening for
