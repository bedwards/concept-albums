# LYRICS


VERSE1
NSA infrastructure analyst
Building systems to surveil the world
Every email, every call, every click
Stored forever in the metadata

He copied files in Hawaii
Flew to Hong Kong with the proof
Met journalists in a hotel room
And showed them what the NSA can do

VERSE2
PRISM, XKeyscore, mass collection
Programs that vacuum up everything
Constitutional? Fourth Amendment?
Classified as state secrets

They revoked his passport mid-flight
Stranded in Moscow airport for weeks
Russia granted temporary asylum
Ten years later, still can't leave

VERSE3
Married his girlfriend in exile
Their son will know a father who can't go home
Espionage charges waiting in Virginia
No chance of a fair trial, he says

But now you know they're watching
Now you know the scope
And you still use your phone
Because what choice do you have

VERSE4
He writes on Twitter from Russia
About encryption and privacy rights
The price of showing Americans
What their government does in the dark

Is a life you can't go back from
Permanent exile, permanent record

CHORUS1
Permanent record in the cloud
Every word you've ever said
He showed you they were listening
Now he can't come home
