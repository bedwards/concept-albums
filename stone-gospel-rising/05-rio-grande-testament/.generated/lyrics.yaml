song:
  title: Rio Grande Testament
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Rio running low
  - Footprints in dust
  - Mother carries water
  - Love the stranger
  verse2:
  - Guard at the border
  - Orders written down
  - He remembered that night
  - Christ a refugee
  verse3:
  - Morning on the mountains
  - Stranger at the gate
  - You were strangers once
  - River still remains
  chorus:
  - I was a stranger
  - You turned me away
  - One law for all
  - You built the wall
  bridge:
  - Herod wanted the child dead
  - So Joseph took his family and fled
  - Egypt welcomed what Bethlehem rejected
  - Every refused refugee is Christ redirected
  outro:
  - The river keeps flowing
  - Can't wall away what God is showing
  - The river keeps flowing
  - Matthew 25:40 - whatever you did to the least
  - You did it to me
