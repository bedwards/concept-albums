song:
  title: The Ratsun
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Faded blue and primer gray
  - The Ratsun in the driveway
  - Keys still warm from your pocket
  - Passenger door that stuck
  - Until you knew just where to kick
  verse2:
  - AM radio and coffee cups
  - The smell of oil and August
  - I learned the roads from your hands
  - On the wheel at ten and two
  - Every turn was something you knew
  verse3:
  - We drove to places that don't exist
  - On maps anymore
  - Diners closed and dance halls gone
  - You showed me where the world had been
  - Before I was born
  verse4:
  - Now the truck sits where you left it
  - Weeds grown through the wheel wells
  - I could fix it if I wanted
  - But I don't want to drive it
  - Without you riding shotgun
  chorus:
  - The Ratsun, the Ratsun
  - Faded blue and primer gray
  - The Ratsun, the Ratsun
  - And I would know you anywhere
