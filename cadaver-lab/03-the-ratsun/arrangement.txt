INTRO
PEDAL STEEL AND GUITAR. Road music.
The pedal steel cries underneath - this is its first appearance on the album.
No drums, no bass. Just the sound of open highway.
Establishing the territory: this is a driving song, a memory song.

VERSE
BASS ENTERS verse 1 - upright, whole notes.
Brushes enter verse 2 - gentle, roadhouse rhythm.
Pedal steel weaves around the vocal.

Verse 1: The truck itself - "faded blue and primer gray"
Verse 2: Learning from riding - "I learned the roads from your hands"
Verse 3: Where you went - "places that don't exist on maps anymore"
Verse 4: Now - "weeds grown through the wheel wells"

Vocal delivery: Nostalgic but not sentimental.
"Before I was born" - wonder, not sadness.
"Without you riding shotgun" - the weight is here, in the final verse.

CHORUS
FULLER but still country-inflected.
Guitar strums, drums more present.
Pedal steel holds long notes.

"The Ratsun holds what we were" - the truck as time capsule.
"I know you by that engine sound" - knowing through shared experience.

BRIDGE
PEDAL STEEL SOLO. 8 bars.
The guitar keeps the pattern.
Let the steel tell the story without words.
This is the sound of driving with someone who's gone.

OUTRO
GRADUAL FADE. Like driving away.
Drums stop first.
Bass fades.
Pedal steel thins to a single note.
Guitar alone, then just the final G.

PRODUCTION NOTES:
- Warm, analog feel. This is country at heart.
- Pedal steel is essential - first appearance, sets up Track 6 and 10.
- ~5:30. Let the instrumental sections breathe.
- The truck is real. The memory is real. Treat it that way.
