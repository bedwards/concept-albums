  title: Beige Chickens
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Beige chickens in the morning
  - Same birds every day
  - Pecking at the gravel
  - In the same deliberate way
  - Deliberate way
  - ''
  verse2:
  - She counted them like rosary beads
  - Before she'd go inside
  - Well-proportioned birds she called them
  - Some small farmer's pride
  - Farmer's pride
  - ''
  verse3:
  - I'd watch her from the kitchen
  - Coffee going cold
  - The way she'd talk to every one
  - Stories never told
  - Never told to anyone but them
  - ''
  chorus:
  - Beige chickens in an ordinary yard
  - That's how you know someone
  - By the ordinary things they tend
  - By the ordinary things they've done
  verse_climax:
  - The coop stands empty now
  - The feed bin rusted through
  - The yard grown over with weeds
  - But I carry what she knew
  - Everything she knew
  - ''
  - How to tend the ordinary
  - How to love what doesn't last
  - How to count your blessings daily
  - Like beige chickens in the grass
  - In the grass
  chorus_final:
  - Beige chickens in an ordinary yard
  - That's how you know someone
  - By the ordinary things they tend
  - By the ordinary things they've done
  - What they've done
  - What they've done
