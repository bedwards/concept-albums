VERSE1
Em  Am
October eighteen fifty-nine
C  G
A Sunday night in the Virginia hills
Em  Am
Eighteen men crossed the Potomac
C  G
With pikes and rifles and a prophet's will


Em  Am
John Brown at fifty-nine years old
C  G
Believed the only path was blood
Em  Am
He'd take the federal armory
C  G
And arm the enslaved for the flood

VERSE2
Em  Am
They took the armory by surprise
C  G
Captured hostages, held the bridge
Em  Am
Waited for the uprising
C  G
That never came down from the ridge


Em  Am
By morning the militia surrounded
C  G
Robert E. Lee's marines arrived
Em  Am
They stormed the engine house at dawn
C  G
Most of Brown's men never survived

VERSE3
Em  Am
They tried him quick in Charles Town
C  G
For treason against Virginia state
Em  Am
He lay wounded on his cot
C  G
And told the court he'd accept his fate


Em  Am
Said if I had done the same
C  G
For the rich instead of the poor
Em  Am
Every man in this court would say
C  G
That I had done nothing wrong at all

VERSE4
Em  Am
December second they led him out
C  G
To the gallows in the morning sun
Em  Am
He handed a note to the guard
C  G
His last prophecy had begun


Em  Am
The crimes of this guilty land
C  G
Will never be purged away
Em  Am
Except with blood - he wrote it down
C  G
Eighteen months before the war began

VERSE5
Em  Am
Now his body lies in the Adirondacks
C  G
Under a granite stone
Em  Am
Some call him terrorist, some call him saint
C  G
Depends on what truth you own


Em  Am
But six hundred thousand men would die
C  G
In the war that came after
Em  Am
And every one of them marched to the song
C  G
That carried John Brown's name

CHORUS1
Am  Em
The raid at Harpers Ferry
C  G
That's how the fire starts
Am  Em
One man's treason is another's truth
C  G
Depending on whose blood you chart
