song:
  title: The Raid at Harpers Ferry
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - October eighteen fifty-nine
  - A Sunday night in the Virginia hills
  - Eighteen men crossed the Potomac
  - With pikes and rifles and a prophet's will
  - ''
  - John Brown at fifty-nine years old
  - Believed the only path was blood
  - He'd take the federal armory
  - And arm the enslaved for the flood
  verse2:
  - They took the armory by surprise
  - Captured hostages, held the bridge
  - Waited for the uprising
  - That never came down from the ridge
  - ''
  - By morning the militia surrounded
  - Robert E. Lee's marines arrived
  - They stormed the engine house at dawn
  - Most of Brown's men never survived
  verse3:
  - They tried him quick in Charles Town
  - For treason against Virginia state
  - He lay wounded on his cot
  - And told the court he'd accept his fate
  - ''
  - Said if I had done the same
  - For the rich instead of the poor
  - Every man in this court would say
  - That I had done nothing wrong at all
  verse4:
  - December second they led him out
  - To the gallows in the morning sun
  - He handed a note to the guard
  - His last prophecy had begun
  - ''
  - The crimes of this guilty land
  - Will never be purged away
  - Except with blood - he wrote it down
  - Eighteen months before the war began
  verse5:
  - Now his body lies in the Adirondacks
  - Under a granite stone
  - Some call him terrorist, some call him saint
  - Depends on what truth you own
  - ''
  - But six hundred thousand men would die
  - In the war that came after
  - And every one of them marched to the song
  - That carried John Brown's name
  chorus1:
  - The raid at Harpers Ferry
  - That's how the fire starts
  - One man's treason is another's truth
  - Depending on whose blood you chart
