/intro/
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa

/verse-1/
I got softened by your patience
I been gentled and re-taught
There was a bloom in the morning
I lost my fear and you were caught

/chorus/
They say time can grow the garden
Because time tends to everything
But time forgot to stop my loving
Yes time forgot to stop my loving

/verse-2/
You took my silence to the kitchen
And you made it into bread
And it rose to fill the window
With the yeast and warmth you spread

/verse-3/
So I took a walk into that garden
And I found your little plot
I knelt to tend until the evening
And in the twilight I stayed caught

/chorus/
They say time can grow the garden
Because time tends to everything
But time forgot to stop my loving
Yes time forgot to stop my loving

/verse-4/
Among the tomatoes I was kneeling
Grateful tears they filled my eyes
And as the first stars rose above us
I looked up in mild surprise

/verse-5/
I knelt beside you in the clover
And I held your weathered hand
Please teach me how to stay much longer
For I finally understand

/outro/
She said time can grow the garden
Because time tends to everything
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
