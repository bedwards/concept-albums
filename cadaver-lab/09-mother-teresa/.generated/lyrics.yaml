song:
  title: Mother Teresa
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - She volunteers on holidays
  - Makes sure everyone can see
  - The photographs, the Facebook posts
  - A saint for all to be
  - All to see
  verse2:
  - I know why she needs the witness
  - I've seen the house she grew up in
  - The way her mother counted kindness
  - Kept a ledger of her sins
  - Of her sins
  verse3:
  - Mother Teresa, they called her once
  - At the office Christmas party
  - She laughed but I saw her flinch
  - At how close they came to seeing
  - Close to seeing
  verse4:
  - Now I hold her contradictions
  - Like I hold all the rest
  - The need to be seen being good
  - Is just another wound undressed
  - Wound undressed
  chorus:
  - Mother Teresa in the break room
  - That's how you know someone
  - By the goodness they perform
  - By what made them need to be undone
