# CHORDS


VERSE1
Am
I learned to read the weather
F
In the set of your shoulders at the door
C  G
Which one would greet me
Am
Which one I'd be waiting for
F  Am
Waiting for

VERSE2
Am
Sometimes the charm came easy
F
Coffee and a joke and sleeves rolled back
C  G
The sun was out inside you
Am
And I'd forget the other tracks
F  Am
Other tracks

VERSE3
Am
Sometimes the pity swallowed
F
Everything the light could reach
C  G
The world arranged against you
Am
And nothing I could say or teach
F  Am
I could teach

VERSE4
Am
Sometimes the rage came sudden
F
Slammed doors and inventory of my faults
C  G
I learned to read the weather
Am
I learned to walk on salt
F  Am
Walk on salt

I learned to read the weather

In the set of your shoulders at the door

Am
Sometimes the rage came sudden
F
Slammed doors and inventory of my faults
C  G
I learned to read the weather
Am
I learned to walk on salt
F  Am
Walk on salt

CHORUS
Am  F
Charm, self-pity, and rage
C  G
All rotating through one face
Am  F
Three weathers, one landscape
C  Am
And I stayed in place
