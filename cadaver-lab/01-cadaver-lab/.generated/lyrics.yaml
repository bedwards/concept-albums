song:
  title: Cadaver Lab
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - I would know you in a lineup of the dead
  - Know you by the bones that hold your hands
  - The vertebrae that curve just so
  - The way your skull remembers every blow
  - Every blow
  - ''
  verse2:
  - I learned this in the cadaver lab
  - Where students name the hidden parts
  - The way a rib cage opens
  - Like a cabinet, like a cart
  - Like a cart
  - ''
  verse3:
  - I've memorized the rhythm
  - Of your footsteps on the stairs
  - The specific weight you carry
  - The particular shade of air
  - Shade of air when you're there
  - ''
  verse4:
  - Now I carry you like water
  - Like a frequency, a hum
  - Every object holds your fingerprints
  - Every room remembers what you've done
  - What you've done
  - ''
  chorus:
  - That's how I know you
  - That's how I know
  - By the architecture
  - And the spaces where you've been
  chorus_final:
  - That's how I know you
  - That's how I know
  - By the architecture
  - And the spaces where we've been
