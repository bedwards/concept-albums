# Cadaver Lab

*I know you so well I'd recognize your bones.*

## The Album

Twelve songs about knowing people deeply. Not their stories - their residue. The objects, vehicles, beaches, and specific rages that prove you paid attention. That prove you were there.

This isn't biography. It's the fragments that stay: a faded pickup truck called The Ratsun, beige chickens in someone's yard, the way charm and self-pity and rage rotated through a single face. The Mercury outboard motor on a summer that shaped you. The day care program where your mother left you - not abandonment, just the ordinary truth that loving someone doesn't mean wanting them there every moment.

These are portraits made of textures. Talismans. The mythology of the people you carry.

## Musical Approach

**Influences:**
- Black Country, New Road - *Ants from Up There* (orchestral crescendos, literary imagery, emotional catharsis)
- Songs: Ohia - *The Magnolia Electric Co.* (objects as mythology, repetition as incantation, earned dynamics)

**Production Philosophy (Rubin):**
- Record like the songs already exist and you're documenting them
- Space is an instrument - don't fill every bar
- Dynamics from whisper to roar, earned not designed
- Dry vocals, close mic, present in the room
- No polish - if the tempo drifts, that's human

**Lyrical Approach (Molina):**
- Never explain, show
- Objects carry emotion - don't tell us what they mean
- Repeat until images become mythic
- Be specific - specific is universal
- Let the listener complete the meaning

**Key Family:** E minor / G major
- Em (i) - melancholy home base
- G (III) - warmth, memory
- C (VI) - nostalgia
- D (VII) - yearning
- Am (iv) - deeper sadness
- Bm (v) - tension

**Tempo Range:** 65-88 BPM - slow enough to hear every word land

## Instrumentation

**Core Ensemble (most songs):**
- Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked, occasionally strummed)
- Upright bass
- Drums (brushes, sticks only on climactic sections)
- Piano (upright, slightly out of tune preferred)

**Additions by song:**
- Pedal steel: tracks 3, 6, 10
- Strings (violin, viola, cello): tracks 1, 7, 12
- Saxophone: tracks 7, 9, 12
- Electric guitar: tracks 7, 11
- Muted trumpet: track 10
- Synth pad: track 12 (outro only)

**Stripped-down songs:**
- Track 4 (Haulover Beach): guitar and voice only
- Track 8 (Mix Tape): guitar, voice, quiet bass

**Near-orchestral songs:**
- Track 7 (Beige Chickens): full ensemble + strings, sax
- Track 12 (Mother's Day Out): everything, building and releasing

**4-6:** Geographical/environmental knowing (beaches, schools, water)
**7-8:** Domestic knowing (daily life, what they share with you)
**9-11:** Difficult knowing (performed virtue, inherited silence, weaponized insight)
**12:** Return to origin (childhood, mothers, the beginning of all knowing)
