TEMPO: 95 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: G

INTRO
Acoustic Guitar: Fingerpicking pattern based on G and C chords. Arpeggiated,
gentle, sets the contemplative mood. Think early Son Volt, the quiet before dawn.
Pedal Steel: Enters bar 5 with long, sustained swells. Not busy - just adding
color and horizon. Volume swells, no attack.
All Others: Silent. Let the song breathe from the start.

VERSE
Acoustic Guitar: Transitions to light strumming. Still restrained, but with more
rhythmic drive. Accents on beats 1 and 3.
Pedal Steel: Sparse swells on chord changes. Supporting, not leading.
Upright Bass: Root notes only, half notes. Deep and steady. The heartbeat.
Vocal: Main melody, conversational delivery. Don't oversing. Let the words carry.
Drums: Brushes on snare, soft kick on 1 and 3. Almost inaudible - just a pulse.
Fiddle/Electric: Silent for first verse. Save their entrance.

CHORUS
Full arrangement opens up, but still restrained. Everyone playing, but listening.
Fiddle: Counter-melody weaving around the vocal. Don't compete - complement.
Electric Guitar: Clean arpeggios, adding shimmer. No distortion, no effects.
Dynamics: mf at most. This isn't a rock chorus - it's a folk revelation.

BRIDGE
Strip it all back. This is the emotional core.
Acoustic Guitar: Return to fingerpicking. Intimate.
Vocal: Exposed, vulnerable. This is the truth of the song.
Pedal Steel: Crying swells. This instrument IS the longing.
Everyone else: Out. Silence is the arrangement here.

CHORUS_FINAL
Build to emotional peak over 12 bars, then fade naturally.
All instruments enter, layering gradually.
Last 4 bars: Fade one by one. Let the resolution be natural.
End on sustained G - the journey continues.

OUTRO
Return to intro instrumentation and pattern.
Instruments drop out one by one over 8 bars.
End with acoustic guitar and pedal steel holding a final G.
The road goes on.
