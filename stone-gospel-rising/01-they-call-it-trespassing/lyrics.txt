# LYRICS


VERSE1
They call it trespassing
When the hungry cross your land
The earth is the Lord's
You built your fence in sand

VERSE2
Sheriff with his paper
Says who drinks who stays dry
Let justice roll like water
Not trickle from on high

VERSE3
Locked the courthouse door
We're sleeping on the stone
The land cannot be sold
The dirt remembers its own

CHORUS
The meek inherit Texas
Every acre every stone
Write your deed in Austin
The dirt knows who it owns
You can write your deed in Austin
But the dirt remembers who it owns

VERSE1
They call it trespassing
When the hungry cross your land
The earth is the Lord's
You built your fence in sand

VERSE2
Sheriff with his paper
Says who drinks who stays dry
Let justice roll like water
Not trickle from on high

VERSE3
Locked the courthouse door
We're sleeping on the stone
The land cannot be sold
The dirt remembers its own

CHORUS
The meek inherit Texas
Every acre every stone
Write your deed in Austin
The dirt knows who it owns
You can write your deed in Austin
But the dirt remembers who it owns

BRIDGE
Woe to you who join house to house
Field to field no space left
Call it progress call it the Texas way
Isaiah named it
Theft

VERSE1
They call it trespassing
When the hungry cross your land
The earth is the Lord's
You built your fence in sand

VERSE2
Sheriff with his paper
Says who drinks who stays dry
Let justice roll like water
Not trickle from on high

VERSE3
Locked the courthouse door
We're sleeping on the stone
The land cannot be sold
The dirt remembers its own

CHORUS
The meek inherit Texas
Every acre every stone
Write your deed in Austin
The dirt knows who it owns
You can write your deed in Austin
But the dirt remembers who it owns

OUTRO
They call it trespassing
We call it coming home
