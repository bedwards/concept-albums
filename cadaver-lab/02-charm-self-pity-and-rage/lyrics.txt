# LYRICS


VERSE1
I learned to read the weather
In the set of your shoulders at the door
Which one would greet me
Which one I'd be waiting for
Waiting for

VERSE2
Sometimes the charm came easy
Coffee and a joke and sleeves rolled back
The sun was out inside you
And I'd forget the other tracks
Other tracks

VERSE3
Sometimes the pity swallowed
Everything the light could reach
The world arranged against you
And nothing I could say or teach
I could teach

VERSE4
Sometimes the rage came sudden
Slammed doors and inventory of my faults
I learned to read the weather
I learned to walk on salt
Walk on salt

VERSE1
I learned to read the weather
In the set of your shoulders at the door
Which one would greet me
Which one I'd be waiting for
Waiting for

VERSE2
Sometimes the charm came easy
Coffee and a joke and sleeves rolled back
The sun was out inside you
And I'd forget the other tracks
Other tracks

VERSE3
Sometimes the pity swallowed
Everything the light could reach
The world arranged against you
And nothing I could say or teach
I could teach

VERSE4
Sometimes the rage came sudden
Slammed doors and inventory of my faults
I learned to read the weather
I learned to walk on salt
Walk on salt

CHORUS
Charm, self-pity, and rage
All rotating through one face
Three weathers, one landscape
And I stayed in place

VERSE1
I learned to read the weather
In the set of your shoulders at the door
Which one would greet me
Which one I'd be waiting for
Waiting for

VERSE2
Sometimes the charm came easy
Coffee and a joke and sleeves rolled back
The sun was out inside you
And I'd forget the other tracks
Other tracks

VERSE3
Sometimes the pity swallowed
Everything the light could reach
The world arranged against you
And nothing I could say or teach
I could teach

VERSE4
Sometimes the rage came sudden
Slammed doors and inventory of my faults
I learned to read the weather
I learned to walk on salt
Walk on salt

VERSE1
I learned to read the weather
In the set of your shoulders at the door
Which one would greet me
Which one I'd be waiting for
Waiting for

VERSE2
Sometimes the charm came easy
Coffee and a joke and sleeves rolled back
The sun was out inside you
And I'd forget the other tracks
Other tracks

VERSE3
Sometimes the pity swallowed
Everything the light could reach
The world arranged against you
And nothing I could say or teach
I could teach

VERSE4
Sometimes the rage came sudden
Slammed doors and inventory of my faults

I learned to walk on salt
Walk on salt

CHORUS
Charm, self-pity, and rage
All rotating through one face
Three weathers, one landscape
And I stayed in place
