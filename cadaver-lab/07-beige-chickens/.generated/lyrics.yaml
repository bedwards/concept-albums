song:
  title: Beige Chickens
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Beige chickens in the morning
  - Same birds every day
  - Pecking at the gravel
  - In the same deliberate way
  - Deliberate way
  - ''
  verse2:
  - She counted them like rosary beads
  - Before she'd go inside
  - Well-proportioned birds she called them
  - Some small farmer's pride
  - Farmer's pride
  - ''
  verse3:
  - She'd park my front door open
  - So I could watch her there
  - The way she'd talk to every one
  - Stories in the morning air
  - Never told to anyone but them
  - ''
  chorus:
  - Beige chickens, beige chickens
  - Pecking at the same gravel
  - Beige chickens, beige chickens
  - And I would know you anywhere
  verse_climax:
  - The coop stands empty now
  - The feed bin rusted through
  - Fox got in or maybe time
  - The yard holds only feathers
  - Only feathers
  - ''
  - I could rebuild the whole thing
  - Buy new birds and paint the wire
  - But her hands are in the wood grain
  - And her voice is in the choir
  - The morning choir
  chorus_final:
  - Beige chickens in an ordinary yard
  - That's how you know someone
  - By the ordinary things they tend
  - By the ordinary things they've done
  - What they've done
  - What they've done
