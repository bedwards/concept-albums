VERSE1
Dm  C
RAND Corporation analyst, top secret clearance
Bb  F
Reading seven thousand pages of Vietnam's truth
Dm  C
Four presidents lied to the public
Bb  F
About a war they knew we'd lose


Dm  C
He Xeroxed every page at night
Bb  F
His kids helping collate the proof
Dm  C
First he tried the Senate, then the Times
Bb  F
Nineteen-seventy-one, the truth broke loose

VERSE2
Dm  C
Nixon called him the most dangerous man
Bb  F
In America, enemy of the state
Dm  C
Broke into his psychiatrist's office
Bb  F
Looking for dirt to discredit his name


Dm  C
Espionage Act, hundred and fifteen years
Bb  F
Facing prison for telling what's true
Dm  C
Then Watergate broke and the case collapsed
Bb  F
Government misconduct set him free

VERSE3
Dm  C
He spent the next forty years speaking
Bb  F
Against every war that came around
Dm  C
Got arrested at the Pentagon at eighty-five
Bb  F
Still saying what shouldn't be allowed


Dm  C
He told Chelsea Manning she did right
Bb  F
He told Snowden he'd done the same
Dm  C
Said the only thing he regretted
Bb  F
Was waiting so long to release those papers

VERSE4
Dm  C
Died in twenty-twenty-three at ninety-two
Bb  F
Watching another generation wake
Dm  C
To the pattern he tried to break
Bb  F
Fifty years too late


Dm  C
But the Pentagon Papers are still online
Bb  F
Supreme Court ruled they could be read
Dm  C
And now you know what he knew in seventy-one
Bb  F
That presidents lie and soldiers bleed

CHORUS1
Bb  F
Seven thousand pages
C  Dm
Of what they knew and hid

The war was lost before it started
C  Dm
But they sent the soldiers anyway
