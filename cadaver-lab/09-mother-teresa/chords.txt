# CHORDS


VERSE1
Am
She volunteers on holidays
F
Makes sure everyone can see
Dm  E
The photographs, the Facebook posts
Am
A saint for all to be
F  Am
All to see

VERSE2
Am
I know why she needs the witness
F
I've seen the house she grew up in
Dm  E
The way her mother counted kindness
Am
Kept a ledger of her sins
F  Am
Of her sins

VERSE3
Am
Mother Teresa, they called her once
F
At the office Christmas party
Dm  E
She laughed but I saw her flinch
Am
At how close they came to seeing
F  Am
Close to seeing

VERSE4
Am
Now I hold her contradictions
F
Like I hold all the rest
Dm  E
The need to be seen being good
Am
Is just another wound undressed
F  Am
Wound undressed

CHORUS
Am  F
Mother Teresa in the break room
Dm  E
That's how you know someone
Am  F
By the goodness they perform
Dm  Am
By what made them need to be undone
