Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa

/verse-1/
I got throttled by my router
I been buffered and ping-blocked
There was a coup in the server
I had a signal but it got dropped

/chorus/
They say time can fix the Wi-Fi
Because time reboots everything
But time forgot to change my password
Yes time forgot to change my password

/verse-2/
He took my bandwidth to the basement
And they had a LAN party there
And the ping grew just like clockwork
It's a lag and packet nightmare

/verse-3/
So I took a cord into that basement
And I found their little rack
I went to stream until the sunset
And in the buffering I came back

/chorus/
They say time can fix the Wi-Fi
Because time reboots everything
But time forgot to change my password
Yes time forgot to change my password

/verse-4/
Outside their firewall I was creeping
Wicked packets filled my mind
And as my old ports lay there sleeping
I snuck in from port 89

/verse-5/
I knelt down by my router's bedside
And I traced its blinking face
Please listen to your firmware dear
For your admin is a disgrace

/outro/
She said time can fix the Wi-Fi
Because time reboots everything
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
