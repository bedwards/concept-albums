# CHORDS


VERSE1
Em
Khaki pants and polo shirts
Am
Carpool line at seven thirty
C  D
Learning how to hold your face
Em
When everything inside feels dirty
Am  Em
Feels dirty

VERSE2
Em
You told me once about the cafeteria
Am
Where you learned to eat alone
C  D
How the laughter sounded different
Em
When it wasn't aimed at anyone you'd known
Am  Em
Anyone you'd known

VERSE3
Em
The conversion van that picked you up
Am
Your mother in the driver's seat
C  D
She never asked about your day
Em
Just drove in silence down the street
Am  Em
Down the street

VERSE4
Em
Now I understand the armor
Am
That you learned to wear so young
C  D
The way you hold your shoulders back
Em
The way you swallow everything unsung
Am  Em
Everything unsung

CHORUS
Em  C
Jacksonville Country Day
G  D
That's where you learned to disappear
Em  C
I know you by what you don't say
G  Em
By the silence you still wear
