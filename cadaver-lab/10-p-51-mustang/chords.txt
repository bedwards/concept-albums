# CHORDS


VERSE1
Em
Model airplane on the shelf
C
P-51 Mustang, silver paint
G  D
He never talked about the war
Em
Just built his models, never complained
C  Em
Never complained

VERSE2
Em
Medals in the bottom drawer
C
I found them after he was gone
G  D
Purple Heart and Silver Star
Em
Never knew what he had done
C  Em
What he had done

VERSE3
Em
Sunday mornings at the hangar
C
Watching planes come in to land
G  D
He'd name them all, every model
Em
But never what they were for
C  Em
What they were for

VERSE4
Em
Now I understand the silence
C
Was the weight he chose to carry
G  D
Protecting us from what he knew
Em
From what made him who he had to be
C  Em
Had to be

CHORUS
Em  C
P-51 Mustang on the shelf
G  D
That's how you know a person
Em  C
By the silence they protect you with
G  Em
By what they never said
