TEMPO: 82 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Amin

INTRO
GUITAR ALONE. Arpeggiated Am-F pattern.
Establishing the quiet before the portrait.
No drums, no bass. Just fingers on strings.
The sound of watching someone approach a door.

VERSE
SPARSE. Guitar continues arpeggio pattern.
Bass enters on verse 2 - upright, whole notes only.
Brushes enter on verse 2 - barely audible.

Verse 1: The thesis - "learned to read the weather"
Verse 2: Charm - "sun was out inside you"
Verse 3: Self-pity - "world arranged against you"
Verse 4: Rage - "walk on salt"

Vocal delivery: Flat, observational. Not accusatory.
This is documentation, not judgment.
"Walk on salt" - let it hang. The image does the work.

CHORUS
SLIGHTLY FULLER but still sparse.
Guitar strums instead of arpeggio.
Bass and drums more present.

"Charm, self-pity, and rage" - say it like a list.
Like reading ingredients. Matter-of-fact.

"And I stayed in place" - the truth underneath.
Not a confession, just a fact.

OUTRO
RETURN TO GUITAR ALONE.
Bass drops out first.
Drums gone.
Guitar arpeggio slowing slightly.
Final Am chord, let it ring.

PRODUCTION NOTES:
- This is a polaroid. Quick, stark, unflinching.
- No reverb. Dry as the truth.
- ~4 minutes. Doesn't need to be longer.
- The portrait is complete. Move on.
