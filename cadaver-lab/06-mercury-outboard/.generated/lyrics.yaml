song:
  title: Mercury Outboard
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Mercury outboard in the morning haze
  - You taught me how to read the water
  - Where the current runs, where the bass would be
  - Without a word between us
  - Between us
  verse2:
  - Pull the cord three times, then wait
  - That's how you said to start the day
  - The engine caught, the boat moved out
  - Everything you couldn't say
  - Couldn't say
  verse3:
  - Barton Springs lifeguard, summer of seventy-three
  - That's where you learned to read the water
  - Just the sound of you still teaching
  - Still your son, still your daughter
  - Still learning what you taught
  chorus:
  - Mercury outboard, morning on the lake
  - That's how you know a person
  - By the things they cannot say
  - By what they taught you anyway
