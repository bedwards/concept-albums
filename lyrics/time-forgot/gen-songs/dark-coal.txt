/intro/
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa

/verse-1/
I got buried by the mountain
I been crushed and chemical-crossed
There was a blast in the mineshaft
I had a brother but he got lost

/chorus/
They say time can heal the coalfields
Because time buries everything
But time forgot to bury the anger
Yes time forgot to bury the anger

/verse-2/
They took our water to the fracking
And they poisoned the well for years
And the cancer grew in our children
It's a black and chemical fear

/verse-3/
So I took a truck to the statehouse
And I parked outside their gates
I went to wait until the session
And when they voted I sealed their fate

/chorus/
They say time can heal the coalfields
Because time buries everything
But time forgot to bury the anger
Yes time forgot to bury the anger

/verse-4/
Outside the chamber I was pacing
Righteous fury filled my brain
And as those bought men cast their ballots
I burst in through the door again

/verse-5/
I knelt before the assembly
And I showed them my poisoned blood
Let history judge what you've done here
You've turned our water into mud

/outro/
She said time can heal the coalfields
Because time buries everything
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
