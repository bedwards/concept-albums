# LYRICS


VERSE1
He wrote code at two in the morning
Downloaded what they said he shouldn't read
Academic journals locked behind paywalls
Research funded publicly

They called it theft, called it breaking in
He called it opening the door

VERSE2
Twenty-six years old in a Boston courthouse
Fifty years in federal time
For downloading documents that should've been free
For believing information wants to climb

Out of vaults and into daylight
Out of profit into hands

VERSE3
They found him in January, winter morning
His family says the trial broke him down
The prosecutors wanted to make an example
So the next kid with a laptop won't come around

Won't ask why public research costs money
Won't wonder who gets to decide what's free

VERSE4
I think about him in the library stacks
Scripts running while the campus slept
Did he know they'd come for him like this
Did he think the weight was one he could accept

Or was he just a kid who saw a door unlocked
And walked through because it should have been

VERSE1
He wrote code at two in the morning
Downloaded what they said he shouldn't read

They called it theft, called it breaking in
He called it opening the door

VERSE2

Fifty years in federal time
For downloading documents that should've been free
For believing information wants to climb

Out of vaults and into daylight

VERSE4

Scripts running while the campus slept
Did he know they'd come for him like this
Did he think the weight was one he could accept

Or was he just a kid who saw a door unlocked
And walked through because it should have been

CHORUS1
This is the story they don't tell
How the brave ones break alone
How the system grinds them down to dust
For touching what they should have owned
