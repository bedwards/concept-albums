TEMPO: 85 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: D

INTRO
GUITAR ALONE. Bright D major, fingerpicked.
The sound of sunlight on water.
This is the most stripped-down song on the album.
Just a guitar. Just a memory.

VERSE
VOICE ENTERS. No other instruments.
Guitar continues fingerpicking pattern.

Verse 1: Setting - "Haulover Beach in August"
Verse 2: Specific image - "backstroke against the afternoon"
Verse 3: Now - "the beach is smaller"

Vocal delivery: Light, almost casual.
"Just bodies there" - not sad, just true.
"Whipper bugs at sunset" - Florida specific, trust the listener.
"Everything's changed" - weight here, but don't push it.

CHORUS
SLIGHTLY FULLER strumming, still just guitar.
"Before the land took hold" - the moment before responsibilities.
"Carries what we told" - the water as keeper.

Keep it brief. This whole song is a sketch, not a painting.

OUTRO
RETURN TO FINGERPICKING.
Slower, like the tide going out.
Final D chord, let it ring.

PRODUCTION NOTES:
- 2:45 maximum. This is the shortest song on the album.
- NO OTHER INSTRUMENTS. Guitar and voice only.
- Bright, warm, slightly overexposed like a beach photo.
- The brevity is the point. Some memories are small.
- Some people we knew briefly but completely.
