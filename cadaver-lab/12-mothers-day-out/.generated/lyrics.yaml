song:
  title: Mother's Day Out
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Tuesday morning, conversion van
  - Baptist church, the parking lot
  - Her hands on my shoulders at the door
  - Then the door, then the hall, then the room
  - Then the window where I watched her go
  - ''
  verse2:
  - Circle time and finger paint
  - Graham crackers on a paper plate
  - Alphabet rug beneath my knees
  - I knew her car by the sound it made
  - But that sound didn't come
  - ''
  verse3:
  - She drove the long way home alone
  - Radio off and windows down
  - Past the Hastings, past the Kroger
  - Past the sheep farm on the county line
  - She needed the quiet, I was the noise
  - ''
  verse4:
  - Now I know that everyone leaves
  - Everyone turns to face the wall
  - Everyone I've loved has closed a door
  - And I have closed doors
  - That's not the wound, that's just the way
  - ''
  verse5:
  - The Ratsun in an empty driveway
  - Beach chair folded against the rain
  - Mix tape rewound to the beginning
  - Beige chickens in an empty yard
  - That's how you know them, by the space they leave
  - ''
  chorus1:
  - Mother's Day Out
  - That's what they called it
  - Mother's Day Out
  - And I'm still learning what it means
  verse_climax:
  - Charm, self-pity, and rage
  - All rotating through a single face
  - Cadaver lab where I learned the bones
  - Mercury outboard in the morning haze
  - ''
  - Everyone I've memorized
  - Everyone whose hands I've held
  - Everyone returns to this
  - The door, the hall, the room, the window
  - The car pulling away
  chorus_final:
  - Mother's Day Out
  - That's what we needed
  - Mother's Day Out
  - Now I understand
  outro:
  - Tuesday morning, my hands on her shoulders
  - Different church, the same parking lot
  - She looks back once, I wave her through the door
  - And I drive the long way home
