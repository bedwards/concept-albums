/intro/
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa

/verse-1/
I got stranded by my brother
I been lied to and let down
There was a scene at the chapel
I had a ring but she left town

/chorus/
They say rain can wash the hurt away
Because rain cleans everything
But rain forgot to wash my memory
Yes rain forgot to wash my memory

/verse-2/
He took my sweetheart down to Austin
And they built a life down there
And she grew old without my knowing
It's a cold and bitter affair

/verse-3/
So I took a bus into that city
And I found their brownstone flat
I went to drink until the midnight
And when the bars closed I came back

/chorus/
They say rain can wash the hurt away
Because rain cleans everything
But rain forgot to wash my memory
Yes rain forgot to wash my memory

/verse-4/
Outside their window I stood waiting
Bitter thoughts they crossed my mind
And as my old love lay there resting
I crept in from the alley blind

/verse-5/
I stood beside their sleeping daughter
And I brushed her auburn hair
Please forgive me little stranger
For the father who wasn't there

/outro/
He said rain can wash the hurt away
Because rain cleans everything
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
