# LYRICS


VERSE1
Intelligence analyst in Baghdad heat
Watching drone footage on repeat
Civilian bodies, Reuters journalists
The report said hostile forces hit

But she had the video, had the proof
Twenty-two years old and bulletproof
She burned it to a disk marked Lady Gaga
And sent the truth out into the dark

VERSE2
Seven hundred thousand documents
War logs that showed what really went
Down in Iraq and Afghanistan
The gap between the truth and what they said

They found her through an informant
Someone she trusted, someone she told
Thirty-five years in military prison
For showing the world what it should have known

VERSE3
In solitary they made her stand at attention
Naked, at midnight, just because they can
The UN said torture, America said necessary
For the soldier who leaked the war

She came out as trans in a men's prison
Fought for hormones, fought to survive
Attempted suicide twice before Obama
Commuted her sentence in twenty-seventeen

VERSE4
Seven years served of thirty-five
She walks free but the record stays
Felon, traitor, whistleblower, trans woman
Depending on who's keeping score these days

But collateral murder is still on YouTube
The helicopter footage she released
And now you know what she knew in Baghdad
Was that freedom, or was that treason

CHORUS1
When the spillway opens
All the water's got to run
Can't hold back the flood
Once the dam is done
