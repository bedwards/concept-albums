# LYRICS


VERSE1
Air Force linguist, NSA contractor
Twenty-five years old in Georgia heat
Reading classified reports on Russian hacking
Of the twenty-sixteen election

She printed out the document
Mailed it to The Intercept, anonymous

VERSE2
They traced the printer by yellow dots
Microscopic tracking code on the page
FBI came to her house, she confessed
Thought honesty might help her case

Espionage Act, sixty-three months
Longest sentence for leaking to the press

VERSE3
Served in Texas, yoga and CrossFit
Adopted a dog from the prison
Released in twenty-twenty-one pandemic
Felon for showing what Russia did

Her name was Reality, a cruel coincidence
When reality itself was under attack

CHORUS1
Reality Winner takes nothing home
Except a record and a dog
Five years gone for telling truth
About an enemy foreign
