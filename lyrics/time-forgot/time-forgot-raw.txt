Time Forgot (To Change My Heart)
 
[Intro]
      D        A         D        A
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
      D        A         C#m      F#m
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
 
[Verse 1]
      C#7           F#m
I got trampled by my woman
       A                   D
I been cheated and double-crossed
            C#7         F#m
There was a coup in the alter
        C#7                F#m
I had a friend but he got lost
 
[Chorus]
         D                 A
They say time can take the pain away
       C#7           F#m
Because time changes everything
    D        A     D         A
But time forgot to change my heart
    D        A     C#7       F#m
Yes time forgot to change my heart
 
[Verse 2]
           C#7            F#m
He took my woman into the country
         A           D
And they had a baby girl
        C#7              F#m
And she grew to look just like me
       C#7              F#m
It’s a mean and wicked world
 
[Verse 3]

            C#7             F#m
So I took a train into that country
      A                   D
And I found their little shack
          C#7             F#m
I went to drink until the sunset
           C#7              F#m
And in the darkness I came back
 
[Chorus]
         D                 A
They say time can take the pain away
       C#7           F#m
Because time changes everything
    D      A       D         A
But time forgot to change my heart
    D      A       C#7       F#m
Yes time forgot to change my heart
 
[Verse 4]
              C#7          F#m
Outside their window I was creeping
       A                        D
Wicked thoughts they filled my mind
          C#7                  F#m
And as my old friends lay there sleeping
  C#7              F#m
I snuck in from behind
 
[Verse 5]
       C#7               F#m
I knelt down by my baby’s bedside
      A                D
And I grazed her lily face
       C#7            F#m
Please listen to your mother dear
         C#7             F#m
For your father is a disgrace
 
[Outro]
         D                 A
She said time can take the pain away
       C#7           F#m
Because time changes everything
      D        A         D        A
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
      D        A         C#m      F#m  D  F#m
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
