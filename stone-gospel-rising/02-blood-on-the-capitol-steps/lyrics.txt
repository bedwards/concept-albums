# LYRICS


VERSE1
Pink granite in the sun
Vote is done
Woe to those who decree unjust laws
Blood on the capitol floor

VERSE2
When you turned the hungry away
You turned him away
Every stolen wage cries out
Depart I never knew you

VERSE3
He overturned the tables once
Drove the money changers out
You made his house a den again
He's coming back to cleanse

VERSE4
You devour widows' houses
Make long prayers for show
Whitewashed tombs full of bones
He called you out long ago

VERSE5
You shut the kingdom's door
Won't enter won't let them in
Strain out gnats swallow camels
Justice mercy faith left to die

VERSE6
The stones are crying out
If they stay silent now
The rocks will tell what you have done
Pink granite stained with blood

VERSE1
Pink granite in the sun
Vote is done
Woe to those who decree unjust laws
Blood on the capitol floor

VERSE2
When you turned the hungry away
You turned him away
Every stolen wage cries out
Depart I never knew you

He overturned the tables once
Drove the money changers out
You made his house a den again
He's coming back to cleanse

You devour widows' houses
Make long prayers for show
Whitewashed tombs full of bones
He called you out long ago

You shut the kingdom's door
Won't enter won't let them in
Strain out gnats swallow camels
Justice mercy faith left to die

If they stay silent now
The rocks will tell what you have done
Pink granite stained with blood
