# CHORDS


VERSE1
G
The sun cuts low through the windshield glass
G  C
Another town that I drove right past
C
The radio fades at the county line
G  D  Em
Just static now where the stations whine
G
Grain elevators standing tall
G  C
Casting shadows through the fall
C
Every mile feels like a prayer
G  D  G
For something waiting out there

VERSE2
G
The diners close by nine PM
G  C
The same old faces, the same old hymns
C
Sunday morning, Monday's weight
G  D  Em
This highway don't negotiate
G
I called you from a payphone booth
G  C
The last one standing, that's the truth
C
Your voice came through like yesterday
G  D  G
Then the quarters ran out anyway

CHORUS
C
On the midwest meridian
C  G
Where the sky meets the dirt
G
Every crossroad's a question
D  Em
Of staying or getting hurt
C
I keep chasing that horizon
D
Like it owes me something still
C  D
On the midwest meridian
G
I probably always will

BRIDGE
Em
Maybe home ain't a place you find
Em  C
Maybe it's just the road behind
C  Am
All those miles I left back there
Am  D  D
Scattered like seeds in the summer air
