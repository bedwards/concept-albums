TEMPO: 138 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Amin

INTRO
MOTORIK LOCK. Drums first - unrelenting.
Kick on 1 and 3. Snare on 2 and 4. Hi-hat 16ths.
This is the NEU! pulse. The autobahn at midnight.

Bar 3: Bass enters - octave pattern, synth bass tone.
A to E, A to E. Hypnotic. Unthinking.

No arpeggio yet. Just rhythm section.
Building anticipation.

SECTION_A
MAIN PATTERN. The transmission begins.

Arpeggio enters - 16th notes, spiraling upward.
Am - F - Am - G progression.
Each chord gets 2 bars.

Pattern: Root - 3rd - 5th - octave - 5th - 3rd - root - 3rd
Repeat. Mesmerizing. Don't think about it.

Synth lead plays single held notes on Am and G sections.
Just e and d. Ghost tones. Barely there.

This is the main groove. Return to it.

SECTION_B
ESCALATION. Lead takes over.

Arpeggio pattern gets more chaotic - wider intervals.
Am - Dm - F - E progression.
The E chord adds tension. Phrygian flavor.

Lead plays actual melody - ascending figures.
e - a - e - c / a - e / d - f - a - d' / etc.

Crash cymbal on 1 of bar 1 and bar 5.

More energy but same hypnotic pulse underneath.

BREAKDOWN
EXPERIMENTAL MOMENT. The demo showing through.

Arpeggio becomes fragmented. Gaps.
"A, C E A z2 E C" - the z2 is the transmission failing.

Drums simplify. Kick every 2 bars.
Space. Negative space.

Lead plays long tones. a and e trading.
Like a signal trying to lock on.

Bars 5-8: Everything rebuilds.
This is the 2am moment. Half-awake decisions.

OUTRO
TRANSMISSION DIES.

Return to section_a pattern but instruments drop out.
Bass first (bar 4).
Drums next (bar 3 hi-hat, bar 4 kick/snare).

Arpeggio alone for bars 5-6.
Bar 6: arpeggio stops mid-phrase.

Bars 7-8: Silence.

The transmission is lost.
No fade. Just gone.
