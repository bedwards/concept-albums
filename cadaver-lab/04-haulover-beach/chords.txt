# CHORDS


VERSE1
D
Haulover Beach in August
G
Salt water in our hair
A  Bm
Sunburn and sand in everything
D
The water didn't care
G  D
Didn't care

VERSE2
D
You in the shallows, backstroke
G
Against the afternoon
A  Bm
Whipper bugs at sunset
D
The water held the moon
G  D
Held the moon

VERSE3
D
Now the beach is smaller
G
Or maybe we grew strange
A  Bm
The salt still tastes the same though
D
Everything else has changed
G  D
Everything's changed

Haulover Beach, Haulover Beach

And I would know you anywhere
