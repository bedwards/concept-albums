# LYRICS


VERSE1
You made me a mix tape once
Handwritten track list, blue ink
Pulp Fiction on the first side
Whatever you were trying to tell me
I think

VERSE2
We drove to Hastings to find the songs
Before everything went digital
You in the aisles with your list
Building something ritual
Ritual

VERSE3
Now I hear those songs on shuffle
And the sequence is all wrong
You had something to tell me
In the order of those songs
Those songs

VERSE1
You made me a mix tape once
Handwritten track list, blue ink
Pulp Fiction on the first side
Whatever you were trying to tell me
I think

VERSE2
We drove to Hastings to find the songs
Before everything went digital
You in the aisles with your list
Building something ritual
Ritual

VERSE3
Now I hear those songs on shuffle
And the sequence is all wrong
You had something to tell me
In the order of those songs
Those songs

CHORUS
Mix tape in a shoebox
That's how you know a person
By the songs they give you
By what they thought you needed to learn
