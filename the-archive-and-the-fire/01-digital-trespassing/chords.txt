# CHORDS


VERSE1
Em  C
He wrote code at two in the morning
G  D
Downloaded what they said he shouldn't read
Em  C
Academic journals locked behind paywalls
G  D
Research funded publicly


Em  C
They called it theft, called it breaking in
G  D
He called it opening the door

VERSE2
Em  C
Twenty-six years old in a Boston courthouse
G  D
Fifty years in federal time
Em  C
For downloading documents that should've been free
G  D
For believing information wants to climb


Em  C
Out of vaults and into daylight
G  D
Out of profit into hands

VERSE3
Em  C
They found him in January, winter morning
G  D
His family says the trial broke him down
Em  C
The prosecutors wanted to make an example
G  D
So the next kid with a laptop won't come around


Em  C
Won't ask why public research costs money
G  D
Won't wonder who gets to decide what's free

VERSE4
Em  C
I think about him in the library stacks
G  D
Scripts running while the campus slept
Em  C
Did he know they'd come for him like this
G  D
Did he think the weight was one he could accept


Em  C
Or was he just a kid who saw a door unlocked
G  D
And walked through because it should have been

CHORUS1
C  G
This is the story they don't tell
D  Em
How the brave ones break alone
C  G
How the system grinds them down to dust
D  Em
For touching what they should have owned
