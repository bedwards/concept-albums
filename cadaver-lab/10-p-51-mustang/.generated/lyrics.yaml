song:
  title: P-51 Mustang
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - Model airplane on the shelf
  - P-51 Mustang, silver paint
  - He never talked about the war
  - Just built his models, never complained
  - Never complained
  verse2:
  - Medals in the bottom drawer
  - I found them after he was gone
  - Purple Heart and Silver Star
  - Never knew what he had done
  - What he had done
  verse3:
  - Sunday mornings at the hangar
  - Watching planes come in to land
  - He'd name them all, every model
  - But never what they were for
  - What they were for
  verse4:
  - Now I understand the silence
  - Was the weight he chose to carry
  - Protecting us from what he knew
  - From what made him who he had to be
  - Had to be
  chorus:
  - P-51 Mustang on the shelf
  - That's how you know a person
  - By the silence they protect you with
  - By what they never said
