# This directory contains GENERATED files
# These files are created by: python scripts/generate_song.py
# Source of truth is in: ../.source/song.yaml
#
# We commit generated files to git for:
# 1. Easy review of changes
# 2. Immediate MIDI playback without regeneration
# 3. CI/CD validation
#
# But you should NEVER edit these files directly.
# Edit ../.source/song.yaml and regenerate.
