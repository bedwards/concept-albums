TEMPO: 84 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Bmin

INTRO
GUITAR ALONE. Bm - tense, unresolved.
The darkest key on the album. Setting up confrontation.

VERSE
BASS ENTERS verse 1, drums verse 2.
Acoustic guitar continues throughout.

Verse 1: The knowledge - "named them all with therapy words"
Verse 2: The warning - "warned me what you'd do"
Verse 3: The contradiction - "working on myself" while hurting you
Verse 4: The lesson - "never seem to change"

Vocal delivery: Not angry. Tired. You've processed this.
"Perfectly rehearsed" - the key insight.

CHORUS
DRUMS FULLER. Building intensity.
"Enlightened narcissist" - say it flat, like a diagnosis.
"You never came around" - the truth.

BRIDGE
ELECTRIC GUITAR ENTERS. Clean but present.
Building toward the final verse.
Drums add hi-hat. More energy.

CHORUS_FINAL
FULL ENSEMBLE. Electric guitar joins acoustic.
"I see you and you see me seeing" - the standoff.
The highest intensity on the album before Track 12.

OUTRO
ELECTRIC CUTS first. Sudden.
Acoustic continues, then fades.
Final Bm. Unresolved on purpose.
This tension carries into Track 12.

~5 minutes. The hardest portrait on the album.
Critical but not vindictive. You understand them too well.
