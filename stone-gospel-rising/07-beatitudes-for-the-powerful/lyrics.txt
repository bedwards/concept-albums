# LYRICS


VERSE1
Blessed are the poor in spirit
You got mansions offshore accounts
Blessed are those who mourn
You criminalize their grief

VERSE2
Blessed are the merciful
Prison empire El Paso
Blessed are the pure in heart
Your hands stained with blood

VERSE3
Blessed are the peacemakers
You profit from the wars
Blessed the persecuted
You persecute the righteous

CHORUS
These beatitudes
Turned back on you
Blessed the meek you pushed aside
Woe to you who lead
Whitewashed tombs
Blessings for the humble
Woes for the proud
Hear the woes out loud

BRIDGE
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees
You shut heaven's door
Lock it in their faces
While you walk free
Woe devour widows' houses
Long prayers for show
Strain out gnats
Swallow camels whole

Woe to the rich who ignore
Same sermon same Lord
One blessing one warning
