/intro/
La la laaa, la la la, la laa laa laaaa
La la laaa, la la la, la laa laa laaaa

/verse-1/
I found her letter on the table
The ink was barely dry
She said she couldn't wait no longer
She didn't say goodbye

/chorus/
They say that whiskey drowns the sorrow
Because whiskey numbs the brain
But whiskey forgot to drown her face
Yes whiskey forgot to drown her face

/verse-2/
I took her picture from the mantle
And threw it in the fire
I watched her smile turn into ashes
Like everything I desired

/verse-3/
I walked out to the barn at midnight
And found my daddy's gun
I held it cold against my temple
But I could not get it done

/chorus/
They say that whiskey drowns the sorrow
Because whiskey numbs the brain
But whiskey forgot to drown her face
Yes whiskey forgot to drown her face

/verse-4/
I put the pistol back and trembled
With hatred in my blood
I drove all night to where she's living
Through the rain and through the mud

/verse-5/
I stood outside her bedroom window
And saw them lying there
I turned around and walked back slowly
Into the cold night air

/outro/
She said that whiskey drowns the sorrow
Because whiskey numbs the brain
La la laaa, la la la, la laa laa laaaa
La la laaa, la la la, la laa laa laaaa
