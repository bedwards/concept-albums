song:
  title: Same Book Different Gospel
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - You read the book
  - I read the book
  - Same words
  - Different god
  - You see heaven coming
  - I see justice now
  - Same cross standing
  - Different blood
  verse2:
  - Obey the state you say
  - Obey God first I say
  - Blessed are the rich
  - Camel through the needle's eye
  - You pick your verses
  - I read what burns
  verse3:
  - Half the text you use
  - Skip the prophets burn the rest
  - Judgment on the powerful
  - Makes you uncomfortable
  - Act justly love mercy
  - Walk humble or don't walk here
  - Don't quote scripture at me
  - Till your hands are clean
  chorus:
  - Same book different gospel
  - Same name different call
  - Love your neighbor
  - You built the wall
  - You're a liar claiming love for God
  - While hating the stranger at your door
  - Same book different gospel
  - We don't pray to the same lord
  bridge:
  - You sanitized him
  - Made him white tame safe
  - He was brown poor executed
  - By your celebrated state
  - He came for the oppressed
  - Not your comfortable theft
  outro:
  - I'll take the Jesus who flipped tables
  - You can keep your country club Christ
  - I'll take the Jesus who touched lepers
  - You can keep your sanitized
  - Same book - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
  - But brother we're reading it wrong or you are
  - And I know which side I'm on
