  title: Mix Tape
  composer: Brian Edwards

  - You made me a mix tape once
  - Handwritten track list, blue ink

  - Whatever you were trying to tell me
  - I think

  - We drove to Hastings to find the songs
  - Just Dance on the TV back home

  - Building something ritual
  - Ritual

  - Now I hear those songs on shuffle
  - And the sequence is all wrong
  - You had something to tell me
  - In the order of those songs
  - Those songs

  - And I would know you anywhere
