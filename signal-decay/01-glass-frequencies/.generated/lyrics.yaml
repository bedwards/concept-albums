song:
  title: Glass Frequencies
  composer: Brian Edwards
sections:
  verse1:
  - I'm tuning to a station that went dark
  - Static where your voice used to be
  - Frequency shifting, nothing to mark
  - The place where you transmitted to me
  - Glass frequencies, I reach but I can't hold
  - Every signal that I catch turns cold
  - ''
  - ''
  verse2:
  - The dial spins but there's nothing left
  - Just the hum of what we used to say
  - I'm holding onto hollow frequencies
  - Watching them decay
  - Glass frequencies, I reach but I can't hold
  - Every wavelength that I touch turns cold
  - ''
  - ''
  chorus:
  - Signal decay, signal decay
  - I'm reaching through the static for your face
  - Signal decay, signal decay
  - Nothing but the echo of this place
