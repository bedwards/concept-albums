Acoustic arpeggiated picking.
Electric enters with single sustained notes (octaves).
Pump organ Gm-Eb sustained, growing.

building to declaration on "Christ redirected".

OUTRO
Return to gentle waltz feel. Acoustic back to fingerpick.
Bass root notes, steady. Kick just on 1, fading.
Vocal "river keeps flowing" sung like a promise.
Final line "You did it to me" - hold on Gm.
All instruments sustain, natural decay.

The river continues...
