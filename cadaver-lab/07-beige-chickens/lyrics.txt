# LYRICS


VERSE1
Beige chickens in the morning
Same birds every day
Pecking at the gravel
In the same deliberate way
Deliberate way


VERSE2
She counted them like rosary beads
Before she'd go inside
Well-proportioned birds she called them
Some small farmer's pride
Farmer's pride


VERSE3
She'd park my front door open
So I could watch her there
The way she'd talk to every one
Stories in the morning air
Never told to anyone but them


VERSE1
Beige chickens in the morning
Same birds every day
Pecking at the gravel
In the same deliberate way
Deliberate way


VERSE2
She counted them like rosary beads
Before she'd go inside
Well-proportioned birds she called them
Some small farmer's pride
Farmer's pride


VERSE3
She'd park my front door open
So I could watch her there
The way she'd talk to every one
Stories in the morning air
Never told to anyone but them


CHORUS
Beige chickens, beige chickens
Pecking at the same gravel
Beige chickens, beige chickens
And I would know you anywhere

VERSE_CLIMAX
The coop stands empty now
The feed bin rusted through
Fox got in or maybe time
The yard holds only feathers
Only feathers

I could rebuild the whole thing
Buy new birds and paint the wire
But her hands are in the wood grain
And her voice is in the choir
The morning choir

CHORUS_FINAL
Beige chickens in an ordinary yard
That's how you know someone
By the ordinary things they tend
By the ordinary things they've done
What they've done
What they've done
