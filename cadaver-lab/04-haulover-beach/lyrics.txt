# LYRICS


VERSE1
Haulover Beach in August
Salt water in our hair
Before we had to be anyone
We were just bodies there
Just bodies there

VERSE2
You in the shallows, backstroke
Against the afternoon
Whipper bugs at sunset
The water held the moon
Held the moon

VERSE3
Now the beach is smaller
Or maybe we grew strange
The salt still tastes the same though
Everything else has changed
Everything's changed

VERSE1
Haulover Beach in August
Salt water in our hair
Before we had to be anyone
We were just bodies there
Just bodies there

VERSE2
You in the shallows, backstroke
Against the afternoon
Whipper bugs at sunset
The water held the moon
Held the moon

VERSE3
Now the beach is smaller
Or maybe we grew strange
The salt still tastes the same though
Everything else has changed
Everything's changed

CHORUS
I knew you in the water
Before the land took hold
Haulover Beach, the tide comes in
And carries what we told

VERSE1
Haulover Beach in August
Salt water in our hair
Before we had to be anyone
We were just bodies there
Just bodies there

VERSE2
You in the shallows, backstroke
Against the afternoon
Whipper bugs at sunset
The water held the moon
Held the moon

VERSE3
Now the beach is smaller
Or maybe we grew strange
The salt still tastes the same though
Everything else has changed
Everything's changed
