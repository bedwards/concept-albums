# LYRICS


VERSE1
Haulover Beach in August
Salt water in our hair
Sunburn and sand in everything
The water didn't care
Didn't care

VERSE2
You in the shallows, backstroke
Against the afternoon
Whipper bugs at sunset
The water held the moon
Held the moon

VERSE3
Now the beach is smaller
Or maybe we grew strange
The salt still tastes the same though
Everything else has changed
Everything's changed

VERSE1
Haulover Beach in August
Salt water in our hair
Sunburn and sand in everything
The water didn't care
Didn't care

VERSE2
You in the shallows, backstroke
Against the afternoon
Whipper bugs at sunset
The water held the moon
Held the moon

VERSE3
Now the beach is smaller
Or maybe we grew strange
The salt still tastes the same though
Everything else has changed
Everything's changed

CHORUS
Haulover Beach, Haulover Beach
Salt water in our hair
Haulover Beach, Haulover Beach
And I would know you anywhere

VERSE1
Haulover Beach in August
Salt water in our hair
Sunburn and sand in everything
The water didn't care
Didn't care

VERSE2
You in the shallows, backstroke
Against the afternoon
Whipper bugs at sunset
The water held the moon
Held the moon

VERSE3
Now the beach is smaller
Or maybe we grew strange
The salt still tastes the same though
Everything else has changed
Everything's changed
