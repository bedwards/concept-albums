TEMPO: 108 bpm
TIME: 4/4
KEY: Dmin

INTRO
COLD START. Synth pad fades in - Dm, lush but distant.
Bar 3: Arpeggio enters, 16th notes, mechanical and precise.
Bar 5: Angular guitar stabs - [D,G] chord, off the beat.
Drums are drum machine - not trying to be human.

Establish the tension before the voice arrives.

VERSE
VOCAL ENTERS - desperate but controlled. Speaking more than singing.
"I'm tuning to a station that went dark" - let "dark" hang.

Guitar plays angular countermelody - staccato two-note stabs.
Never on the beat. Always syncopated. Post-punk jitter.

Bass is octave-heavy, driving. Synth bass tone.

Verse 2 follows same pattern. Build slightly.
"Watching them decay" - the word "decay" sets up the chorus.

CHORUS
OPENS UP. Synth pad goes higher register.
"Signal decay, signal decay" - incantation, not screaming.

Guitar plays fuller chords but still angular voicings.
Arpeggio descends instead of ascending.

Hi-hat goes to 16ths - energy increase but still machine.

"Nothing but the echo of this place" - let it ring.

BRIDGE
INSTRUMENTAL BREAKDOWN. 8 bars.
Synth arp EXPOSED - solo moment.
Everything else drops back.

Dm - F - Bb - A progression.
The F chord is unexpected - momentary warmth before returning to cold.

Guitar barely there. Single stabs.
Drums simplify to kick and snare only, then hi-hat returns.

OUTRO
DECAY. The signal failing.
Guitar out first. Single stab, then gone.
Bass drops next.
Drums fade.

Just synth pad and arpeggio remain.
Arpeggio continues alone for final 4 bars.
Last bar: arpeggio stops mid-phrase. Cut. Silence.

The station went dark.
