  verse1:
  - NSA infrastructure analyst
  - Building systems to surveil the world
  - Every email, every call, every click
  - Stored forever in the metadata
  - ''
  - He copied files in Hawaii
  - Flew to Hong Kong with the proof
  - Met journalists in a hotel room
  - And showed them what the NSA can do
  verse2:
  - PRISM, XKeyscore, mass collection
  - Programs that vacuum up everything
  - Constitutional? Fourth Amendment?
  - Classified as state secrets
  - ''

  - Stranded in Moscow airport for weeks
  - Russia granted temporary asylum
  - Ten years later, still can't leave

  - Their son will know a father who can't go home
  - Espionage charges waiting in Virginia

  - ''
  - But now you know they're watching
  - Now you know the scope
  - And you still use your phone
  - Because what choice do you have

  - He writes on Twitter from Russia
  - About encryption and privacy rights

  - ''
  - Is a life you can't go back from
  - Permanent exile, permanent record
  chorus1:
  - Permanent record in the cloud
  - Every word you've ever said
  - He showed you they were listening
  - Now he can't come home
