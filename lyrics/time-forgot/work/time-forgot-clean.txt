/intro/
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa

/verse-1/
I got trampled by my woman
I been cheated and double-crossed
There was a coup in the alter
I had a friend but he got lost

/chorus/
They say time can take the pain away
Because time changes everything
But time forgot to change my heart
Yes time forgot to change my heart

/verse-2/
He took my woman into the country
And they had a baby girl
And she grew to look just like me
It's a mean and wicked world

/verse-3/
So I took a train into that country
And I found their little shack
I went to drink until the sunset
And in the darkness I came back

/chorus/
They say time can take the pain away
Because time changes everything
But time forgot to change my heart
Yes time forgot to change my heart

/verse-4/
Outside their window I was creeping
Wicked thoughts they filled my mind
And as my old friends lay there sleeping
I snuck in from behind

/verse-5/
I knelt down by my baby's bedside
And I grazed her lily face
Please listen to your mother dear
For your father is a disgrace

/outro/
She said time can take the pain away
Because time changes everything
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
Da da daaa, da da da, da daa daa daaaa
