# CHORDS


VERSE1
Em
I would know you in a lineup of the dead
C
Know you by the bones that hold your hands
G  D
The vertebrae that curve just so
Em
The way your skull remembers every blow
C  G
Every blow
Em


VERSE2
Em
I learned this in the cadaver lab
C
Where students name the hidden parts
G  D
The way a rib cage opens
Em
Like a cabinet, like a cart
C  G
Like a cart
Em


VERSE3
Em
I've memorized the rhythm
C
Of your footsteps on the stairs
G  D
The specific weight you carry
Em
The particular shade of air
C  G
Shade of air when you're there
Em


VERSE4
Em
Now I carry you like water
C
Like a frequency, a hum
G  D
Every object holds your fingerprints
Em
Every room remembers what you've done
C  G
What you've done
Em

That's how I know you
