# LYRICS


VERSE1
I would know you in a lineup of the dead
Know you by the bones that hold your hands
The vertebrae that curve just so
The way your skull remembers every blow
Every blow


VERSE2
I learned this in the cadaver lab
Where students name the hidden parts
The way a rib cage opens
Like a cabinet, like a cart
Like a cart


VERSE3
I've memorized the rhythm
Of your footsteps on the stairs
The specific weight you carry
The particular shade of air
Shade of air when you're there


VERSE4
Now I carry you like water
Like a frequency, a hum
Every object holds your fingerprints
Every room remembers what you've done
What you've done


VERSE1
I would know you in a lineup of the dead
Know you by the bones that hold your hands
The vertebrae that curve just so
The way your skull remembers every blow
Every blow


VERSE2
I learned this in the cadaver lab
Where students name the hidden parts
The way a rib cage opens
Like a cabinet, like a cart
Like a cart


VERSE3
I've memorized the rhythm
Of your footsteps on the stairs
The specific weight you carry
The particular shade of air
Shade of air when you're there


VERSE4
Now I carry you like water
Like a frequency, a hum
Every object holds your fingerprints
Every room remembers what you've done
What you've done


CHORUS
That's how I know you
That's how I know
By the architecture
And the spaces where you've been

VERSE1
I would know you in a lineup of the dead

The way your skull remembers every blow
Every blow

And the spaces where we've been
