INTRO
GUITAR AND PEDAL STEEL. Water music.
The pedal steel continues from Track 3 - memory and roads now memory and water.
Morning haze. The sound of an engine that hasn't started yet.

VERSE
BASS ENTERS verse 1, brushes verse 2.
Pedal steel weaves around the vocal.

Verse 1: The lesson - "how to read the water"
Verse 2: The ritual - "pull the cord three times"
Verse 3: The inheritance - "still your son, still your daughter"

Vocal delivery: Grateful, not sad. This is a love song.
"Everything you couldn't say" - the weight is here.

CHORUS
"By the things they cannot say / By what they taught you anyway"
The thesis: some people teach by doing, not speaking.

OUTRO
PEDAL STEEL AND GUITAR fade together.
The sound of the boat heading back to shore.
~4 minutes. Warm, grateful, country-inflected.
